kuczynski | Psychosis is a mental impairment that is precipitated and sustained by a break with external reality | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | Neurosis is a mental impairment that is precipitated and sustained by a break with one's emotional condition | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | The neurotic flees from his emotions; the psychotic flees from reality | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | Neurosis may lead to a blunting of one's awareness of certain aspects of external reality, but any such loss of awareness is subordinate to loss of awareness of one's emotional condition | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | Similarly, psychosis may lead to a disruption of one's understanding of one's emotional condition, but any such disturbance is subordinate to the psychotic's loss of awareness of external reality | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | Though symmetrical in the just-described respects, neurosis and psychosis are ultimately not mirror images of each other | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | This is a consequence of the fact that psychosis involves a partial regression to a condition of psychological infancy, the operative term being 'partial' | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | An infant is not psychotic | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | The infant's psychological condition is integrated and healthy, even though the infant's understanding of reality is even more subjective, and therefore more projective, than that of the adult psychotic | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | The adult psychotic, on the other hand, has the psychological architecture of an adult as well as that of an infant | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | Therefore, the psychotic has two entirely distinct and incompatible ways of processing information | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | He does not have a unified value system; he does not have a unified understanding of how to implement such values as he has; and his psychological condition is therefore therefore one of utter disarray | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | And therein lies the peculiarly damaging nature of psychosis. Nothing comparable holds of the neurotic | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | Neurosis is about containing threats to one's integration by repressing them | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | To repress a conceit is not to bury one's knowledge of it in the unconscious; it is rather to bury one's knowledge of its emotional valence in the unconscious | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | As a result, the neurotic's condition is one of relatively unimpaired intellectual awareness | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | In fact, in some circumscribed ways, it may be even be a condition heightened intellectual awareness, owing to the fact that the neurotic is likely to compensate for his impoverished emotional state by hypercathecting his intellect | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | Moreover, by stripping the contents of consciousness of their emotional valences, the neurotic guarantees that he has a hyper-stable, though also an ossified psyche | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | The essence of psychosis is an inability to organize consciously experienced emotion; the essence of neurosis is an inability to have consciously experienced emotion | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | The former is paralyzed by a superabundance of emotion, the latter by lack of it | Neurosis vs Psychosis
kuczynski | For men, happiness is about forging one's own identity | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | For women, happiness is about being loved | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | Men are happy if they triumphed over their own fathers, and women are happy if their fathers loved them | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | For a man to triumph over his father is for him not to submit to his father | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | It is for him to establish his own identity | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | He can establish his own identity by doing the opposite of what his father does | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | Schopenhauer's father was a wealthy merchant. Schopenhauer was a great philosopher who spoke with contempt of merchants | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | Mozart's father was a good composer; Mozart was a great composer | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | Trump's father was a moderately successful business man; Trump is an extremely successful businessman | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | There are three ways a man can fail | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | He can try to fill his father's shoes but fail | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | He can submit to his father without even going so far as to try to fill his shoes | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | He can have no father at all and thus have no father to triumph over or to fail to triumph over | Happiness and Identity
kuczynski | Compulsive Work is about avoidance | Compulsive Work
kuczynski | Here one must distinguish between two kinds of workaholics | Compulsive Work
kuczynski | There is the workaholic who loves what he is doing: this person works because he wants to work | Compulsive Work
kuczynski | Then there is the workaholic who hates what he is doing: this person works because he doesn't want to work | Compulsive Work
kuczynski | The workaholic who loves his work is not working compulsively, and this form of workaholism is not about avoidance | Compulsive Work
kuczynski | But the workaholic who hates his work is working compulsively, and this form of workaholism is about avoidance | Compulsive Work
kuczynski | This type of workaholic is avoiding doing what he wants to do, and because he hates what he is doing, he has to do it compulsively | Compulsive Work
kuczynski | Stuttering is about not speaking with a single voice | Stuttering
kuczynski | Two distinct currents of thought are attempting to control one's speech | Stuttering
kuczynski | To the extent that these two thought-currents are evenly matched, one stutters | Stuttering
kuczynski | To the extent that one of these thought currents dominates the other, speech is normal | Stuttering
kuczynski | Men are self-contained and woman are not. That is the difference between men and women | Gender
kuczynski | Obviously there are men who are not self-contained and there are women who are self-contained. But such men are not really men, and such women are not really women | Gender
kuczynski | One learns from adversity, not from failure | Learning
kuczynski | that one learns more from failure than from success | Learning
kuczynski | This is not true | Learning
kuczynski | Each success opened up new and completely unforeseen vistas | Learning
kuczynski | Each failure was nothing but a dead end, from which I learned nothing, except that what I was doing led to a dead end | Learning
kuczynski | One learns nothing from failure | Learning
kuczynski | One learns from adversity | Learning
kuczynski | Failure is not adversity | Learning
kuczynski | Failure is the end-result of adversity that was not triumphed over | Learning
kuczynski | Does everybody want money? Yes. Everybody | Money
kuczynski | That is itself a way of wanting money | Money
kuczynski | His attitude towards money is that of a jilted and petulant lover | Money
kuczynski | Overblown feelings are the opposite of what they are supposed to be | Emotions
kuczynski | Emotions that are what they seem to be are not the objects of intense scrutiny on the part of those who have them | Emotions
kuczynski | Attitudes that are pressed into the service of tendentious narratives about oneself are the opposite of what they seem to be | Emotions
kuczynski | The Number #1 Rule of Writing is that one must immediately write down every thought that occurs to one | Writing
kuczynski | If one waits, the moment will pass, never to be recovered | Writing
kuczynski | It is irrelevant that one should 'memorize' what it is that one wanted to say, since the idea that originally came to mind was merely a foil for a constellation of unconscious ideas | Writing
kuczynski | Elsewhere I have said that the Number #1 rule of writing is complete honest | Writing
kuczynski | if one follows the above-stated injunction, one is ipso facto an honest writer | Writing
kuczynski | Lack of coordination has to do with a failure to be centered, which in turn has to do with a failure to have an objective that one truly believes in | Coordination
kuczynski | Lack of physical coordination is accompanied by, since it is a manifestation of, a lack of psychological coordination | Coordination
kuczynski | A given psychological condition is pathological if it restricts freedom and non-pathological if it does not | Pathology
kuczynski | A given condition is positively counter-pathological if it augments freedom, even if it is unusual or even unique | Pathology
kuczynski | The #1 Rule rule of business is that you must do what comes naturally to you | Business
kuczynski | You must not go against your own grain | Business
kuczynski | You must work hard, but you must not work hard fighting your own nature | Business
kuczynski | Just as writer's block only afflicts those who are not writing from the heart, so 'entrepreneur's block' only afflicts those who are not working from the heart | Business
kuczynski | so 'entrepreneur's block' only afflicts those who are not working from the heart | Business
kuczynski | When people choose a given path because it is who they are, they succeed | Business
kuczynski | When they do so because they have an agenda, they do not | Business
