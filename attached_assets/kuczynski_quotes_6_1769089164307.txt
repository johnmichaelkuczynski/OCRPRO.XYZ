Kuczynski | Some knowledge is direct; some is indirect. Indirect knowledge is knowledge that is acquired through inference. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | To make an inference is to form a new belief on the basis of an old one. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Inferences, when legitimate, are made in accordance with legitimate rules of inference. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Rules of inference, when legitimate, correspond to dependence-relations. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | There are two kinds of dependence-relations: logical and causal. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Logical dependence-relations hold among propositions. A proposition is a truth or a falsehood. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | The proposition that x is a triangle cannot be true unless the proposition that x has three sides is true. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Therefore, x s being a triangle depends on x s having three sides. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Causal relations hold among states of affairs, not truths and falsehoods. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Smith cannot pass the class unless Smith studies. Therefore, Smith s passing depends on his studying. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | The objects of knowledge are propositions. It isn't known unless it's believed and it isn't believed unless it's a proposition. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | One can be aware of non-propositions, e.g. rocks, trees, people, but one does not in the relevant sense know them. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Rather, one knows truths about them. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Some dependence-relations are known, not through sensory observation, but through conceptual analysis. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Such truths are analytic, as opposed to empirical. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Analytic knowledge is always knowledge of dependence-relations. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Empirical knowledge can be either direct or indirect; the same is true of analytic knowledge. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Knowledge is conceptually articulated awareness. In order for me to know that my shoes are uncomfortably tight, I need to have the concepts shoe, tight, discomfort, etc. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | I do not need to have these concepts---or, arguably, any concepts---to be aware of the uncomfortable tightness in my shoes. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | My knowledge of that truth is a conceptualization of my awareness of that state of affairs. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | There are two kinds of awareness: propositional and objectual. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | My visual perception of the dog in front of me is a case of objectual awareness, as is my awareness of the tightness of my shoes. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | My knowledge that there is a dog in front of me is a case of proposition-awareness, as is my knowledge that my shoes are uncomfortably tight. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Observations are objectual awarenesses. The contents of such awarenesses must be converted into propositions if they are to be explained. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | This is because it is truths that are explained, and truths are true propositions. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | To explain some avalanche or lightning-bolt x is to explain why it is a truth that x occurred. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Causal relations can be known only through one s senses (through sight, touch, etc.) and through real-time awareness of one s own psychological processes. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | In other words, causal relations can only be known empirically; and knowledge of them is therefore empirical. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Theoretical truths are necessarily known through inference, and knowledge of such truths is therefore inferential. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | But not all inferential knowledge is theoretical knowledge. I notice that you look tired and on that basis know that you didn't get enough sleep. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | A theory is given by a proposition that, if true, describes some relatively comprehensive fact about the structure of the universe. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Theoretical knowledge is either (i) Knowledge of such a theory (e.g. your knowledge of evolutionary theory) or (ii) Knowledge that is derived from knowledge of such a theory. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | If you know it, then (i) You believe it, (ii) It is true, and (iii) Your reasons for believing it are legitimate. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | At the same time, given only that it's true and that you are justified in believing it, it doesn't follow that you know it. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | If your belief that it's noon is based on the read-out of a broken clock, it isn't knowledge, even if that clock happens to be right and, in addition, you know it to be relatively reliable. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Your belief would have been knowledge had you acquired it by virtue of being en rapport with the relevant realities; and the reason it wasn't knowledge is that it was not so acquired. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | For you to be en rapport with those realities is for you to be linked to them by structures that are information-transmissive, as opposed to merely evidence-generative. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Causal necessity is different from logical necessity. Given that x is a triangle, it is logically necessary that x have three sides. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Given that x is an ice-cube that was just placed on a very hot surface, it is causally necessary that x begin to melt. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | One state of affairs e is evidence of another state of affairs e* iff (if and only if) e and e* are causally related in such a way that, if one knows of e s existence, one has reason to believe in e* existence. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | If one knows that Smith is coughing up green phlegm, one has reason to believe that Smith has a lung infection. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Therefore, Smith s coughing up phlegm is evidence of Smith s having a lung infection. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | S is a causal series if S consists of events e1 en such that, for any i (1?i?n), ei is the cause of ei+1. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | All information is evidence, but not all evidence is information. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | The elevator s stopping at the 5th floor is evidence of somebody s pushing a certain elevator-related button. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | But neither event bears information about the other, owing to the fact that, since they have different structures, the first didn t transmit its structure to the second. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Our sense-perceptions are isomorphs of the objects they represent: the latter transmit their structures to the former. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | A perception-like experience is veridical, and therefore a bona fide perception, just in case it inherits its structure from its object, and accurate to the extent that it does so. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | It is only to the extent that our sense-perceptions, taken both individually and collectively, inherit the structures of their external counterparts that our perception-based beliefs are accurate. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | It is only to the extent that our beliefs are linked by information-transmissive series to the corresponding realities that those beliefs are knowledge. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | A testimony-based belief is knowledge only if the testimony in question is constitutive of an information-transmissive link to the externality in question. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | A belief based on the testimony of a dishonest person is knowledge, so long as the testimony in question was information-transmissive. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | A belief based on the testimony of an honest person is not knowledge unless the testimony in question was information-transmissive. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | For one event e to precede another event e* is for there to be a possible causal process beginning with e and ending with e*. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | For e and e* to be simultaneous is for there to be no such process. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Effects are continuations of their causes. An event transmits information about its cause to the extent that the former inherits its structure from the latter. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Knowledge is initially acquired through information-transmission series---our thoughts inherit their structures from our perceptions, which inherit their structures from the corresponding externalities. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | On the basis of this knowledge, we can acquire knowledge of non-information-transmissive evidential relations. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | But knowledge of the latter kind presupposes knowledge of the former kind. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Each of (a) and (c) supports predictions and counterfactuals; (b) does not do so, and neither does an accidental, albeit place- and time-invariant, generalization, such as (d) nothing in any region of space-time that is made of solid gold weighs exactly n oz., for an appropriate value of n. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | The difference between (a) and (c) is one of degree: (a) is more approximate than (c) and (a) also has less scope than (c). | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | In order to discover the structure of the world, we must organize the data at our disposal; and in order to organize the data at our disposal, we need to use principles, such as (a), that are of limited scope and are only approximately true. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | But were that condition met, there won t be any need for science; and so long as it isn t met, principled but defeasible generalizations, like (a), are to be co-categorized with principled, non-defeasible generalizations, like (c), i.e. they are to categorized as laws of nature. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | With every increase in our knowledge, there is a change in what there is to know about the world, given that any given instance of knowledge is no less a constituent of the world than is a rock or a chair. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Therefore, attempts to plug up the holes in our knowledge of the world create new such holes, it being the purpose of science, not to eliminate such holes, but to minimize their number and to restrict the scope of those cannot be eliminated. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | The difference between (a) x is human?x is cyanide-intolerant and (b) x is human?x is shellfish-intolerant is not to be understood in statistical terms. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | It is inherent in what it is to be physiologically human (or otherwise mammalian) that a human being be cyanide intolerant. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | The reason that no one is cyanide-tolerant is that a person s being cyanide-intolerant is rooted in his having a distinctively mammalian physiological make- up. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Laws of nature are not perfect concomitances: for it to be a law of nature that instances of phi bring about instances of psi is not for each and every phi to be followed by an instance of psi. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | For there to be such a law is for instances of phi to be dispositive, for reasons of a relatively non-context-specific nature, of the occurrence of instances of psi. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | If x causes y, then x and y are events. They are not are not rocks, trees, or snowmen. They are not things, in other words, at least not in the sense in which we will use that word. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Though not themselves causes or effects, things have causal properties. The rock weighs three lbs.; and it is in virtue of this fact about the rock that certain events involving the rock have certain effects. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Conditions, e.g. Smith s having high blood pressure, can be causes and effects. This is because conditions are event-pluralities and therefore events in their own right. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | For your metabolic condition to remain unchanged is for the various events constitutive of it to continue to occur within certain limits; it is for your heart to continue to beat at a certain rate; it is for the cells composing your body to be duly oxygenated at regular intervals; etc. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | For the room s temperature to remain constant is not for the various particles involved to undergo no change. It is for the changes that they are constantly undergoing to remain within certain limits; it is for those changes to remain such that their mean kinetic energy doesn t change. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | An event is a change. Therefore, all causes and all effects are changes. But we take for granted, and thus cease to be aware of, the occurrence of the changes constitutive of stable conditions; and we thus tend to reserve the use of the word change for changes in patterns of change. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Scientific knowledge enables us to explain past events and to predict future ones, and it thereby enables us, within limits, to control the course of events. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | In contexts in which there are stable patterns of events, it tends to be possible to explain, predict, and control what happens; and it tends to be impossible to do so in contexts in which there are no such patterns and which therefore consist of rogue events. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Given some event En, En s program-cause is a structure or stable condition that, although not by itself determinative of En, predetermines the occurrence of some structure- internal specific event En-1 that is thus determinative. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Freud correctly says that, if a given person X succumbs to a given psychology malady M, four different kinds of causes are likely to be operative: (1) X s precondition (how X was before he was afflicted with M); (2) M s specific cause (the trauma that, though it did not itself suffice for X s succumbing to M, made it inevitable that the slightest disturbance in X s condition would thus suffice); (3) M s concurrent cause (some trauma experienced by X, e.g. a recent break-up, that is operative independently of (2) and isn t constitutive of X s precondition); (4) The immediate or precipitating cause of M (some specific event, e.g. the sound of a car backfiring, that pushes X, who has thus far been on the threshold that separates those who suffer from X from those who don t, just past that threshold). | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | When Freud says that a given psychological event e is overdetermined, he means that it was brought about by the confluence of two or more psychological events each of which justified e s occurrence. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Thus, if Freud was right, as he surely was, causation in the psychological sphere often involves the exceeding of thresholds: it isn t enough that x have just one reason for falling in love with y; unless he has several reasons, nothing happens; but once enough such reasons accumulate, the damn bursts and x falls in love with y. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Discontinuous changes tend to involve threshold effects. A circuit breaker doesn t do anything until there is electricity-overload, at which point it shuts off the electrical pathway in question. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | To the extent that the world changes discontinuously, it has a digital structure, and to the extent that it changes continuously, it has an analogue structure. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | It follows that e was an insufficient but non-redundant part of a condition that unnecessary but sufficient for e* s occurrence that, in other words, that e was an INUS condition for e*. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Statements of the form if P had been the case, then Q would have been the case are counterfactual conditionals (or counterfactuals). | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Thus, many counterfactuals are to the effect that one thing caused another to happen and many counterfactuals therefore hold in virtue of dependence-relations of the causal variety. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | But some counterfactuals hold in virtue of dependence-relations, not of the causal, but of the logical variety. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Thus, all counterfactuals affirm the existence of instances of necessitation of some kind or other, and all therefore counterfactuals therefore hold in virtue of dependence-relations of one kind or other. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | According to David Lewis (1972, 1984), the meaning of (1) is (1#) If w is a world in which Kennedy was not assassinated but is otherwise as much like our world as that fact allows it to be, then in w the US pulled out of Viet Nam before 1965. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | This means that counterfactuals hold in virtue of the logical and causal structure of our world, as opposed to other worlds. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Given that the cause of an event is what guarantees its occurrence, the boiling of the water is, insofar as it guaranteed the occurrence of the likes of c1 cn, appropriately described as the cause of the cracking of the vessel. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | In general, where there is causal redundancy, causal truths cannot be converted into counterfactual truths. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | According to CAC, the meaning of (#) e is the cause of e* is (#*) If e hadn t happened, then e* wouldn t have happened. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Ordinarily the meaning of (#) is taken to be (#^) e compelled e* to occur, i.e. e s occurrence necessitated e* s occurrence. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | CAC is meant to provide one such way of reinterpreting causal claims. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | A theory is extensionally correct if there are no counterexamples to it. A theory is intensionally correct if, first, there are no counterexamples to it and, second, the reason there are no counterexamples to it is that it is a correct description of what it's supposed to describe. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | CAC is extensionally false. For (#*) If e hadn t happened, then e* wouldn t have happened is not always consequence of (#) e is the cause of e*. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | CAC is also intensionally false. Suppose it true both that (A) The otherwise unthreatened bird died because Smith shot it and also consequently that (A*) if Smith hadn t shot it, the bird would not have died. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | In general, supposing that e is the cause of e*, it is only if e is insufficiently described that if e hadn t happened, then e* wouldn t have happened fails to be a consequence of e is the cause of e*. | Causation
Kuczynski | There are three problems with CACD. These have to do with (i) Events whose causes involve the exceeding of thresholds, (ii) Events whose causes are mechanisms that can be implemented in different ways, and (iii) Events whose causes program for their occurrence. | Causation
Kuczynski | At time t, I push the button and the elevator comes as a result. Had I not done so, someone else might have pushed the button at t and the elevator would still have come, and the result would have been the same: the elevator would have come at the same time, in the same way. | Causation
Kuczynski | The button is a binary-mechanism. When the elevator comes isn t a function of the way in which the button is pushed, and neither is the manner in which the elevator comes. | Causation
Kuczynski | Thus, had some other person pushed the button, the result would have been the very same event that resulted from my pushing the button. | Causation
Kuczynski | Therefore CACD is false, given that, according to it, the (hypothetical) event resulting from the other person s pushing the button would not have been numerically identical with the (actual) event resulting from my pushing it. | Causation
Kuczynski | In general, the identity of a given threshold effect is not contingent on the specific composition of its antecedents. Thus, where threshold effects are concerned, there is genuine causal redundancy, and CACD is therefore false. | Causation
Kuczynski | My hitting ENTER caused a 3 to appear on the LCD. But if I hadn t hit ENTER, the 3 still would have appeared, since my friend Gus would have hit ENTER had I not done so. | Causation
Kuczynski | In general, software-level activity---meaning, ultimately, any causal-series that can be implemented in different ways---is to be distinguished from the event-series by which it is implemented, notwithstanding that the two series are spatiotemporally coincident. | Causation
Kuczynski | In general, the identity an event that can be implemented in different ways isn t contingent on its exact composition or, therefore, on the exact composition of its cause. Thus, where such events are concerned, there is genuine causal redundancy, and CACD is therefore false. | Causation
Kuczynski | Given that the batter was on a hot griddle, it was inevitable that some such micro-events occur, even though it obviously wasn t inevitable that those specific micro-events occur. | Causation
Kuczynski | Therefore, if m1 mn hadn t occurred, the conversion-process still would have occurred, thanks to some entirely distinct confluence of micro-events m*1 m*m. | Causation
Kuczynski | In general, the identity of an event whose cause programs for it is not contingent on its specific composition or on the precise identity of its immediate antecedents. Thus, where such events are concerned, there is genuine causal redundancy, and CACD is therefore false. | Causation
Kuczynski | According to CAC, e is the cause of e* iff e* wouldn t have happened had e not happened. Frankfurt s proves that CAC is false. | Causation
Kuczynski | My pushing the button is the cause of the elevator s coming, but the elevator might have come even if I hadn t pushed the button somebody else might have pushed it. Therefore, CAC is false. | Causation
Kuczynski | According to Hume, e1 is the direct cause of e2 iff any event that is similar to e1 spatially adjacent to an immediately posterior event that is similar to e2; and e1 is the indirect cause of en iff, for each i (1?i?n), any event that is similar to ei spatially adjacent to an immediately posterior event that is similar to ei+1. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume holds that, if e is the direct cause of e*, then there is a law to the effect that any event similar to e is adjacent to an immediately posterior event that is similar to e*. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume therefore holds that laws are regularities and causal sequences are instances of such regularities. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume therefore rejects the conventional view, according to which laws are structures that are responsible for such regularities and are therefore distinct from them. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume therefore rejects the conventional view, according to which causes are responsible for their effects and are therefore not merely their antecedents. | Causation
Kuczynski | If there is any empirical (observational) basis for saying that e caused e*, it is (i) The fact that e was e* s immediate predecessor and neighbor, coupled with (ii) The fact that events similar to e are always the immediate predecessors and neighbors of events similar to e*. | Causation
Kuczynski | There are two kinds of causal processes: (i) Those that involve interactions and (ii) Those that consist solely of instances of persistence. | Causation
Kuczynski | Following Bertrand Russell, we will refer to type-(i) causation as transeunt causation and to type-(ii) causation as immanent causation. | Causation
Kuczynski | Anything that endures for any length of time is a series of instances of immanent causation and is thus a causal series: a series of states of affairs such that any given such state, apart from the last, is the cause of a structurally similar such state and any such state, apart from the first, is the effect of a similar such state. | Causation
Kuczynski | The difference between immanent and transeunt causation is that immanent causation is, whereas transeunt causation is not, structure-preserving. | Causation
Kuczynski | Any given case of transeunt causation involves the cessation of a structure-preserving causal series. | Causation
Kuczynski | The essence of transeunt causation is the discontinuous alteration of object-constitutive causal-series. | Causation
Kuczynski | The essence of transeunt causation is discontinuity. The essence of immanent causation is continuity. | Causation
Kuczynski | A consequence is that the world has a digital structure to the extent that it hosts instances of transeunt causation, and an analogue structure to the extent that it hosts instances of immanent causation. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume takes it for granted that all instances of causation are identical with such disruptions, and Hume therefore takes it for granted that those continuities per se are non-causal. | Causation
Kuczynski | Because Hume took breakdowns of causal cohesiveness as instances of such cohesiveness, he believed causation to be a relation between disjoint entities. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume claims that there is no empirical basis for preferring (a) e made e* happen to (b) e*-similar events always follow immediately antecedent neighboring e-similar events. | Causation
Kuczynski | Given that the actual and the hypothetical situations are observationally indistinguishable, it follows that no causal nexus linking cause and effect can be observed in the actual situation. | Causation
Kuczynski | In general, genuine causal processes are observationally distinguishable from pseudo-causal processes. And what observation reveals is that the events composing a genuine causal sequence are continuous with each other, whereas those events composing a pseudo-causal sequence are merely contiguous with each other, effects are continuous with their causes, and not merely contiguous with them. | Causation
Kuczynski | These points suggest that the essence of causation is continuity: a continuous event-series is a causal process; a discontinuous event-series is a non-causal process, even if every non-terminal member of that sequence is contiguous with its success and every non-initial member is contiguous with its predecessor. | Causation
Kuczynski | The temporal order is to be understood in terms of the causal order, not vice versa. Hume's analysis assumes otherwise and is therefore viciously circular and therefore false. | Causation
Kuczynski | Correlation is not causation. A consequence of Hume s analysis---indeed, the very essence of it---is that correlation is causation. Therefore, Hume s analysis is false. | Causation
Kuczynski | Given any spatiotemporally adjacent events, e and e*, there is some regularity of which that event-sequence is an instance. Hume s analysis therefore entails that any two spatiotemporally adjacent events are related as cause and effect. Since this isn t the case, Hume s analysis is incorrect. | Causation
Kuczynski | There is no way to assign relative dates or positions to events except on the basis of their causal interrelations. | Causation
Kuczynski | Truths about spatiotemporal interrelations are therefore truths about causal interrelations, and the spatiotemporal order is to be understood in terms of the causal order. Hume assumes otherwise, and his analysis is therefore incorrect. | Causation
Kuczynski | Epiphenomenal causation is not actual causation; it is pseudo-causation. e is the epiphenomenal cause of e* iff (i) Any e-similar event is immediately succeeded by an adjacent e*-similar event, (ii) e is not the cause of e*, and (iii) The cause of each of e and e* is some underlying causal mechanism e#. | Causation
Kuczynski | Reality abounds with instances of epiphenomenal causation. If a thermometer is immersed in hot water, the upward-movement of the column of mercury immediately precedes an adjacent acceleration of the particles composing the walls of the thermometer. But the former is not the cause of the latter; the cause of each is the fact that the thermometer in hot water. | Causation
Kuczynski | Computers are structured in such a way that bona fide causal processes are mirrored by pseudo-causal causal processes. Visible desktops operations are manifestations of invisible software activity. | Causation
Kuczynski | According to DN, E is explained iff, supposing that C is a description of the circumstances in which E occurred and L is a description of the laws operative in C, then the proposition that E occurred is a logical consequence of the conjunction of C and L. | Causation
Kuczynski | Laws are given by propositions that support counterfactuals. Increasing gas-temperature increases gas-volume is a law because, other things being equal, the greater the gas s temperature, the greater the volume it occupies. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hempel s proposal (widely accepted among DN-advocates, since they have no other choice) is this: whereas metal expands when heated supports counterfactuals, all the coins in JM s pocket are quarters does not. | Causation
Kuczynski | Thus, a law is a generalization that supports counterfactuals. In this way, DN has seemingly insulated itself against the charge that nomic statements express causal relations and therefore against the consequent charge that DN is wrong to hold that explanations are categorically law-based. | Causation
Kuczynski | Counterfactuals are cryptocausal statements; to know causes is to know explanations; to explain an event is to identify its cause. Therefore, DN is guilty of vicious circular in so far as its legitimacy is predicated on laws being counterfactual supporting. | Causation
Kuczynski | it follows that explanations are not, at least not in general, law-based and, more precisely, that they do not, at least not in general, have the form to explain E is to identify known laws L1 Ln such that, if C1 Cm is a description of the antecedents of E, then E is a logical consequence of L1 Ln+C1 Cm. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | According to Hempel, if we want to know that the rope snapped, we need to know (i) What the conditions were that obtained prior to the rope s snapping, and (ii) What the natural laws were in virtue of which those conditions led to the rope s snapping. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | when Hempel tells us that E is to be explained in terms of the conditions preceding it, what Hempel means, assuming it true, is that the rope-snapping is a consequence of the relevant preconditions (e.g. the integrity of the rope, the weight of the suspended object, the distance of that object from the body that is dragging it downward, the density of that body). | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | We can t provide a deductive-nomological explanation of E unless we know, for each E s infinitely many preconditions, whether or not that precondition is relevant to E; and if we know a given precondition C is relevant to E, then we ipso facto know that C caused E, and, since to explain an event is to identify its cause, we ipso facto have an explanation of E. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Thus, in order to provide a deductive-nomological explanation of E, we must already have an explanation of E. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | For me to have a high-resolution understanding of why E happened, I do indeed know the how, and not just the what. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | For me to know why Smith is sick it is not enough for me to know what made him sick (he ate rotten fish); I also need to know how his eating rotten fish led to his being ill. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | But if I know, as I surely can, that Smith is sick because he ate rotten fish, I surely do have knowledge of an explanation of his condition, even though that explanation is low-resolution. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Similarly, if I know what led to the rope s snapping (it was made of bubble gum and there was a heavy ball attached to it), I am surely aware of a correct explanation of the rope-snapping. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If I know which laws were involved, then I surely have a much better explanation of that same event: I have a scientific explanation of that event, whereas I previously did not. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Earlier it was pointed out that we seem to know of individual cases of metal s being heated and expanding for that reason before we know of the law in virtue of which heated metals expand: indeed, a precondition for our knowing of such a law seems to be that we know of individual cases of metal expanding in consequence of being heated. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | We see many cases of metal objects being heated and then expanding. We are puzzled. So we posit a law L to the effect that metal expands when heated. Now that we (think we) know of this law, we are no longer puzzled. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | You say that we can t know of L s existence until we know of individual cases of metal objects expanding in consequence of being heated. This is not correct. We know of metal objects expanding upon heated. But until we know of L, we don t know that there to be a cause-effect relationship between those objects being heated and their expanding. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If our only reason for thinking that x expands when heated is that x does expand when heated, then in positing a law to the effect that they are causally connected, all we are doing is saying: 'It is so; for it must be so.' | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | In which case, L doesn t really explain anything. And in which case, furthermore, there is insufficient evidence for L, a consequence being that L isn t really a law so much as it is a tentative hypothesis, which, being of questionable veridicality, cannot serve as the basis of an explanation. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | By the same token, if we have good reason to believe L to be a law, we must have reason to believe, independently of L, that this particular piece of metal expanded because it was heated, the same being true of that piece of metal piece, and also of that other piece of metal, and so on. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Physical laws as regularities of proportion Threshold effects aside, effects are proportional to their causes. This has several consequences, none of them consistent with RA or with DN. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | First of all, laws are not expressed by regularities. A collision may or may not displace an object. It may be destroy it. It may not destroy it, but may fail to make it budge. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If conditions are held constant, then events that are identical in respect of momentum or temperature (or whatever the relevant parameters are) have the same effects, in which case causal relations are expressed by regularities. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Second, to the extent that laws are expressed by regularities, they are expressed by regularities of proportion: volume increases directly proportional to temperature increases; gravitational attraction is proportional to the masses of the bodies in question. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | So if indeed causal nexuses are regularities, they aren t regularities of the form e-similar events always precede e*-similar events. They are regularities of proportion and are therefore regularities of a much more abstract kind than those that the DN-advocate has in mind. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | But circumstances don't remain constant, and they don't have to remain constant for us to learn what causes what. Events are changes. The greater the change, the greater then effect. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | As long as we can correlate input-differences with output-differences, we can establish causality. A corollary is that a singular events are the effects of a singular antecedent, and, when given a singular event, we know its cause as soon as we identify a singularity among its antecedents. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Do such dalliances always lead to venereal disease, or even most of the time? No. Does it matter? No. You know of some event predating your malady that is as singular as your malady. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | And this proves the point at hand, that, when e is known to be the cause of e*, it isn t because e-e* is an instance of a perfect regularity; it s because, of e* s various antecedents, e is the only one that is proportional to e*. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Given that we can know what causes a given event without knowing of any law L that links cause and effect, it follows, given that to explain an event is to identify its cause, that we can sometimes explain events without explaining them in terms of laws. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | To explain an event in detail is to explain how the specifics of the event depended on the specifics of the cause, and for that we do need laws. We need laws if we are to have scientific explanations. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | But scientific explanations presuppose prescientific explanations. We must distinguish between non-explanations and pre-scientific explanations. Non-explanations are not pre-scientific explanations. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If my explanation of the fact that I burnt my hand is that I touched a hot surface, my explanation is correct, but not scientific. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If it is always so obvious what causes what, why do scientists bother with tests? Why do they repeat the same experiment over and over? | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Scientific tests have a number of functions. First of all, people s causal beliefs aren t always correct. This is partly due to the fact that, as was pointed out in class, a given event may have a number of equally salient antecedents. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Another reason is that experiments identify specific information about causes that is not easy to come by in non-experimental settings. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If e is the cause of e*, e precedes e*. Given that no event is instantaneous, this means that each takes time to occur and, therefore, that it takes time for both of them to occur. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Thus, given any non-null time-interval, interval-initial circumstances of a given kind are compatible with interval-terminal circumstances of many different kinds. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Therefore, instances of causation are not instances of regularity. For e to be the cause of e* is not for e-similar events to always precede e*-similar events. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | It follows that laws are not regularities. It also follows that laws are not forces or structures that are responsible for regularities. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | According to Hume, we know that e causes e* because (i) e immediately precedes, and is adjacent with, e*, and (ii) e-similar events always immediately precede adjacent e*-similar events. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | This is not typically how we learn what causes what. If it is known that, apart from being collided with by ball A, hitherto stationary ball B was in a state of equilibrium, then it is known that the collision was necessarily the cause the change in B s state of motion. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Thus, if we know that e is the cause of e*, it isn t necessarily because we have observed some regularity of which that event-sequence (e followed by e*) is an instance. In many cases, there is no such regularity. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | It may be that, unless one has knowledge of laws, one cannot know why a given event followed some other event. But without knowledge of laws one can obviously know that the first event was indeed the cause of the second. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Hume seems to have thought that, unless it is known why the collision caused the hitherto stationary ball to move---unless Newton s second law of motion is known, along with A s momentum at the time of the collision and B s mass it cannot be known that the collision is the cause of its moving. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | To know what caused an event is to know how to explain it. I can explain your tantrum: I insulted you. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | This shows that, contrary to what DN assumes, not all explanations are law-based. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | In some cases we know that e causes e*, and we are therefore know a (low-resolution but otherwise) correct explanation of the latter, even though we don t know of any law that connects the two events. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | It also shows that knowledge of (low-level but otherwise) correct explanations of facts is a prerequisite to knowledge of natural law. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | In order to learn Newton s second law (the acceleration of an object depends directly upon the net force acting upon that object and indirectly on the object s mass), one must know that certain collisions are responsible for certain displacements. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | If one doesn t know this, then one a fortiori doesn t know that among the (invariably very numerous) laws determinative of the exact nature of the accelerations of the displaced objects, one of them is that the acceleration of the displaced object is inversely proportional to its mass and directly proportional the net force acting on it. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | One quite glaring failure of DN concerns its treatment of psychological explanations. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | If DN is right, as Hempel makes clear, not a single one of the psychological explanations ever put forth identifies the cause of any psychological event. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | If DN is right, I don t know that my insult is the cause of your tantrum unless I know of some perfect regularity of which that event-sequence is an instance. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Outside of physics and chemistry, any such regularities as are to be found are imperfect. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | And a consequence of DN, therefore, is that, outside of those two disciplines, nothing has ever been explained. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | It may well be that nobody knows the complete explanation of any given psychological event. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | But a consequence of DN is that, pending the discovery of some perfect regularity of which the insult-tantrum event-sequence was an instance, it simply isn t known whether or not the insult was in any way, to any degree, the cause of the tantrum. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | The cause of many a psychological event is known, even though the corresponding regularity, if there is one, is not known; and if the corresponding regularity is known, it isn t necessarily implicated in one s knowledge of the relevant event-sequence. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | You may well know that people who are dumped feel sadness. But it isn t on the basis of this knowledge that you know that the reason you are sad is that you were dumped. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | DN entails that, unless you know of some regularity of which your writing this fugue is an instance, you cannot possibly know that your doing so is a consequence of your being dumped. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | DN also entails that, unless people who are dumped always respond by trying to impress their exes, no person s attempting to rekindle his/her ex s affections through a heroic deed is a consequence of him/her being dumped by said ex---which is false---and a fortiori it cannot be known of some particular act of valor performed by some dumped person that his/her heroic deed is a consequence of him/her being dumped---also false. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Hempel acknowledges that perfect regularities often are not available. And he says that, in such cases, one must rely on imperfect regularities: regularities of the form e-similar events usually precede e*-similar events. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | The probability that an insult will elicit a tantrum is small: most insults do not result in tantrums. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | And supposing that 95% of insults were followed by tantrums, there would not, at least not for that reason, be a statistical law to the effect that 95% of tantrums follow insults; for it might not be that the tantrums in question were consequences of the antecedent insults. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | In general, supposing that most phi s are followed by psi s, it doesn t follow that phi s cause psi s, even part of the time, or a fortiori that there is a statistical law to the effect that n% of phi s cause (or are followed by) phi s (for some n>50). | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | But that isn t because they re in a swimming pool; it s because (in most cases) they re in a public place. They are often, presumably, wearing bathing gear despite being in a swimming pool. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Contrariwise, given only that 30% of phi s are followed by psi s, it doesn t follow that phi s don t cause psi s. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Smoking causes emphysema; but only emphysema occurs in less than 30% of people who smoke the requisite amount (the amount the emphysemics smoked, at least before they got emphysema). | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | What is true of emphysemics is that the only distinctive thing about their behavior was that they were heavy smokers. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | But the statistical relevance model, being nothing more than a watered down version of the Deductive nomological model, has the latter s defects but not its virtues; and it s not really worth running the diagnostics on this obviously degenerate and degenerating research program. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | DN doesn t hold with respect to all explanations; it isn t possible to give deductive nomological explanations of events until it is known what is causally relevant; and to the extent that one knows what is causally relevant to what, one already has knowledge explanations. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | So far as DN is correct, it s a correct description of scientific explanation, a scientific explanation of E being one that says both (i) What made E happen and (ii) How it did so. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | As a matter of logic, sentences that are logically equivalent must be confirmationally equivalent, but there are logically equivalent sentences that are not confirmationally equivalent (e.g. all ravens are black and all non-black things are non-ravens ). | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Logical equivalence: S1 and S2 are logically equivalent iff S1 entails S2 and S2 entails S1. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Confirmational equivalence: S1 and S2 are confirmationally equivalent iff, given any datum D, D confirms S1 to degree n iff D confirms S2 to degree n. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | It follows, by an indirect proof, that logical equivalence entails confirmational equivalence. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Consider: R1: All ravens are black (if x is a raven, then x is black), and R2: All non-black things are non-ravens (if x is non-black, then x isn t a raven). R1 and R2 are equivalent. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Consider: R3: x is a pink piano. R3 confirms R2, but not R1. The pinkness of pianos has nothing to do with the blackness of ravens. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Consider: M1: Heated metal expands (if x is metal, then x expands when heated), and M2: Heated non-expanders aren t metal (if x doesn t expand when heated, then x isn t metal). The equivalence of M1 and M2 is easily verified using Venn diagrams. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Consider: M3: Cube steaks shrink when heated. M3 confirms M2, but not M1: The deflationary tendencies of heated meat have nothing to do with the expansionary tendencies of heated metal. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Hempel s solution R3 does confirm R1 and R2 equally. We think otherwise because, our background beliefs being what they are, we believe it impossible that pianos should be ravens. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Similarly, M3 does confirm M1 and M2 equally. We think otherwise because, our background beliefs being what they are, we believe it impossible that cube steaks should be made of metal. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | We can t learn anything about ravens by studying pianos. We can t learn anything about metal by studying meat. Hempel s solution implies otherwise and is therefore false. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | For there would be no undetectable processes---no electron-jumps, nothing too small or too remote to be observable or to have observable consequences---that, if per impossible it were known of, would be a reason to hold that U2 was a continuous of some pre-t* universe. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Operationally speaking, U1 would be as distinct from U2 as a world where Dick Cheney is president in 2014 is from our world. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Relative to U2, that is to say, U1 would simply be a hypothetical universe; and, should that hypothetical universe exist, the relation borne by it with respect to U2 is the same as the relation borne by a universe in which Cheney is president in 2014 with respect to our universe. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This doesn t mean that U1 doesn t exist. It means that, operationally speaking, it is no more a constituent of any universe of which U2 is a constituent than a 2014 Pres. Cheney Universe is a constituent of a universe of which our universe is also a constituent. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Suppose that that there are non-initial, U2-internal events e1 en that occur ex nihilo, i.e. that there are events e1 en that happen in U2 that happen after t*, the interval between them and t* between non-null, that don t have any roots in preceding U2-internal events. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | An ex nihilo event is one that has no roots in anything preceding it, its occurrence be no more favored by the preceding state of the universe than its non-occurrence. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If (1), then the post-t# space-time manifold---let U3 be this manifold---bears the same relation to U2 that U2 bears to U1, in which case, operationally speaking, U2 and U3 are no more jointly constitutive of some one space-time manifold than are U1 and U2. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If (2), then there are events e^1 e^o such that e^1 e^o precede t# and eventuate, by way of continuous processes, in post-t# events, then U3 s relationship to U2 is not the same as U2 s relationship to U1. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Under that circumstance, U2 and U3 do jointly constitute a single space-time manifold. But that does not by itself guarantee that e1 en are constituents of that manifold. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Suppose that e1 en have no effects on any events in U2 or U3. In that case, they neither cause, nor are caused by, U2-internal events or U3-internal events; and in that case, for now familiar reasons, nothing in U2-U3 has anything to do with them and, operationally speaking, e1 en don t exist as far as U2 and U3 are concerned. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Thus, the supposition that there are ex nihilo events that are U2-internal is predicated on the assumption that those events are causally connected to U2-internal events that do not occur ex nihilo. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This means that, if we know e and e* to belong to the same space-time manifold, then we know there to be some causal connection between them; we know that either (i) e causes e*; (ii) e* causes e; or (iii) some third event e# causes, or is caused by, both. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If observation apprises us of such a connection, then, as far as e and e* are concerned, we don t need to posit unobserved continuities. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If observation does not apprise us of such a connection, we do have to posit hidden continuities, since the non-existence of such continuities is incompatible with the datum that e and e* are part of the same space-time manifold. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Because we observed each and were therefore affected by each. Since causally connected events are ipso facto co-occupants of some one space-time manifold, e and e* are such co-occupants. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Suppose we posit some continuous event-series E such that e causes e* by way of E. If E actually exists, then each segment s of E that lasts for a non-null time-period must satisfy the following condition: s s existence/occurrence cannot be incompatible with that of event e! that is known to occupy the same space-time manifold as e and e*. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This means that, if e$ is the event that connects e1 to e2 and constitutes the intersection-point of the series connecting e1 and e1 and the series connecting e and e*, then e$ must be continuous with its predecessor and its successor in each of two distinct event-series. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This means that to validate the datum that two events, e and e*, are part of the same space-time manifold, it is necessary to posit unobserved events that link those two events. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | In fact, given two non-simultaneous events, in order to validate the datum that they belong to the same space-time manifold, it is necessary to posit a continuous process CP connecting them (either directly or way of some third event to which they are both related as cause/effect) such that every segment of CP is identical with the segment of each of the infinitely many event-series that intersects with CP. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Herein lies the justification for positing unobserved continuities to explain observed events in terms of other observed events. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Given only that there is a causal connection of some kind between any two co-occupants of some single manifold, how does it follow that the causal connections between past (known) events will bear any resemblance to future (or otherwise unknown) events? | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Hume s attempt to delegitimize induction presupposes that the laws of physics can just be suspended. That presupposition in its turn assumes that the laws of physics are separable from the space-time manifold; it assumes, in other words, that they are not constitutive of that manifold. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Laws are not independent of one another. In actuality, gas-pressure is directly proportional to temperature. If it were inversely proportional to temperature, every one of the laws of mechanics would have to be jettisoned or heavily modified. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If the speed of light were framework-relative, then mass and energy would no longer be capable of being converted into each other, at least not in accordance with the same laws that govern such conversions in actuality. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Also, if light did not have a framework-constant velocity, all of our metrical conventions would be thrown off. There would be no principled ways of determining position or, therefore, velocity or, therefore, rates of growth or expansion. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Thus, if at time t* the laws of physics changed, then the positions, masses, velocities, temperatures, etc. of many, if not all, of the occupants of the post-t* universe (U2) would be discontinuous from their pre-t* (U1) positions, masses, etc. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This means that, if the laws of physics changed at time t*, the result would be the obliteration of the space-time manifold---the universe---in which those laws were operative. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Different laws, different spatiotemporal manifold. Different spatiotemporal manifold, different universe. The space-time manifold isn t an empty vessel that can house different laws; it is defined by the laws that govern its occupants. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | We have already seen that, if post-t* events are discontinuous with pre-t* events, then there is no single space-time manifold that U1 and U2 jointly constitute. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This is a datum, as we have seen, because, if a given person is to know of each of two events, each of those events must have affected him; and if each of two events affects a given thing, all three things are ipso facto part of some one space-time manifold. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | According to U, the laws of physics don t change. Hume says that any assurance we have as to U s veridicality is induction-based and, therefore, that we have no such assurance. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | We know that U is true because, if it weren t, nothing would persist---literally---include the very entities that make inductive inferences. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | U is a precondition for the making of inductive inferences; so as long as makers of inductive inferences, U holds and inductive inferences either go through or, if they fail, they fail for reasons of incompetence (failure to identify the relevant parameters, failure to compute the relevant sums, etc.), and because of anything having to do with the legitimacy of inductive inference per se. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Objects (rocks, trees, stars: stable, dynamically unified event-patterns) are systems of interacting parts. The laws governing such systems would cease to exist at t. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If the laws of physics were different, there would be no electrons, since to be an electron is inter alia to be governed by certain laws. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Objects are constituted by the forces that govern them; those forces are instances of physical laws. Different laws, different forces; different forces, different objects. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Owing to the nomic changes occurring at t, there would be no sense in which anything happening before t could the cause of anything happening after t. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Thus, given that the laws of physics change at t, then there would be no space-time manifold of which both U1 and U2 were constituents, and the supposition that the laws of physics change at t is therefore tantamount to the supposition that the space-time manifold ceases to exist at t. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This means that if there are physical laws, then, until time comes to an end, our inductive practices have a legitimate basis. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Many inductive inferences do not concern the future; they concern what is present or past but is unknown. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If I inductively infer that, at this exact time, some object is still solid, that inference doesn t concern the future. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If I inductively infer that, several thousand years ago, an asteroid hit a certain part of the Earth s surface, that inference obviously doesn t concern the future. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | So, provided that physical laws exist, many inductive inferences are unqualifiedly legitimate. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | The fact that such precautions must be taken shows that, at any given time, what one can learn about the world is quite circumscribed; that if it s impossible to know X at time t, it may be possible to learn about X at later time t*. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | But the thesis that the universe is completely predictable requires that, for any time t, it is possible, at t, to predict how, for any later time t*, the universe will be at t*. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Laplace s thesis, it will be objected, is that a creature of infinite intelligence could predict how things will be. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Prediction requires both intelligence and knowledge, and there is no conceivable being that acquire complete knowledge of the state of the universe at any point in time. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | If one is to have a sense-perception of a given thing, there must be an information-bearing causal process linking that thing to oneself. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | In order to learn about the subatomic world, one must irradiate it, i.e. flood it with light or otherwise bombard it with radiation of some kind or another. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | But because light is composed of particles (photons) whose masses are comparable to those of the particles that the microphysicist aspires to learn about, the effect of flooding the microphysical world with light is to change it utterly. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | If you use a flame thrower to learn about a school of rodents, you will succeed up to a point: their charred remains will give you tell you a lot about them: but it won t tell you everything. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | It being inherent in the nature of sensory knowledge that it involve a causal connection between subject and object, there is no conceivable being that could have complete knowledge of the microstructure of the world. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Therefore, nothing could have complete knowledge of the conditions obtaining at t, for any time t, or, consequently, at any later time t*, given that knowledge of the future is necessarily based on the knowledge of the present. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Knowledge of the future= Knowledge of initial conditions+knowledge of laws+ The knowledge yielded by making the inferences warranted by the first two kinds of knowledge. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Supposing that such and such facts are inherently unknowable, then why grant their existence? By supposition, they might as well not exist, even if they do. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | One fact which falls within the scope of science is that, in order to learn about the world, we must interact with it. Another such fact is that interactions have effects. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Given that two facts that do fall within the scope of science entail that there are things about the world that cannot be known, it follows that, for science no less than for metaphysics, the world is to some extent unknowable. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | There has never been a single photon of which any person was aware; but we know that photons exist, since, if they didn't, the photoelectric effect could not be explained. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | No creature can possibly predict what it will come to know. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Suppose you know now, at time t, that, during the next 20 years, you will learn truths t1 tn, and no other truths. In that case you now know t1 tn and they therefore aren t what you will learn in the next 20 years. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Given that what you know affects what you do, and thus affects how the world is, it follows that no creature can know exactly what it will do or, therefore, exactly how what it will do will affect the world. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | If x and y are identical in respect of their microphysical properties, then it is inconceivable that they should differ in respect of their biological properties. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | In general, one class of facts supervenes on another class of facts exactly if there can t be a change in the former without there being a change in the latter but not vice versa. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Given two pieces of clay that are identical in respect of their strictly physical properties (e.g. their shapes, masses, etc.), it is inconceivable that they should differ in respect of their aesthetic properties. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | But aesthetic properties cannot be identified with physical (physics-related) properties. First of all, two objects that are physically different can be aesthetically identical. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | The aesthetic is thus multiply realizable with respect to the physical. The same is true, for the same reasons mutatis mutandis, of the biological. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | A biological mechanism of a given kind can be implemented by entities that are physically very different from one another. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Software is variable with respect to hardware. Software-identical systems may be hardware-distinct. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | It is said that the mental supervenes on the physiological: given two creatures that are physiologically identical, it is impossible that they should differ psychologically. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | It is incoherent to suppose that two entities that are microphysically identical should differ biologically. By contrast, it is not incoherent, though it is counternomic, to suppose that two physiologically identical creatures should differ in respect of their psychological properties. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Nothing can violate the laws of physics. There are no mass-energy displacements that are not governed by the laws of physics. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | For this reason, many have thought that everything (everything spatiotemporal, that is) can be explained in terms of the laws of physics. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | The statue is not identical with the clay of which it consists. They have different modal properties (one can destroy the statue without destroying the clay); so the clay isn t identical with the statue. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | The laws of physics tell you how those atoms behave. They don t tell you anything about the computer. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | The laws of physics don t say anything about computation, storage space, etc. Those concepts (computation, etc.) don t exist as far as those laws are concerned. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | So a physics-omniscient being does not in virtue of that fact have any computer-specific concepts and therefore does not have any computer-related knowledge. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Two software-identical units may be physically very different. So given only that x and y are software-identical, nothing can be said about their respective physical realizations. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Consequently, there is no way to map software-truths onto hardware-truths. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | The similarities in question are to be understood in terms of concepts (e.g. computation, recursion, algorithm) for which the laws of physics make no provisions. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | To the extent that x is a computer---to the extent that x is something that implements a program---x is a deterministic system. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | It is only to the extent that x is failing to implement a program that x is indeterministic. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Given only that biologically identical inputs may be followed by biologically distinct outputs, it doesn t follow that the laws (if any there be) of biology are indeterministic or probabilistic. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Supposing that the laws of physics are indeterministic, it doesn t follow that higher-order laws are indeterministic. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Supposing arguendo that the laws of microphysics are indeterministic, it doesn t follow that aggregates of microparticles behave indeterministically, for the reason that the various norm-non-compliant behaviors on the part of individual particles cancel one another out. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Statistics are evidence of probabilities; statistics are not themselves probabilities. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | According to FT, statistics are identical with probabilities; therefore, FT is false. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Also, statistics are only as truth-conducive as they are consistent with the causal mechanisms that generate them. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | When it is said that that probability of a computer-malfunction is greater than 0%, the statement being made is to be interpreted causally, not statistically. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Measuring an object s length involves assigning a real number to its length: same length, same number; different lengths, different numbers. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Number-assignments are therefore meaningless unless they are consistent with (i)-(iii). | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A scalar quantity is one that is given by a single number, as opposed to an ordered n-tuple. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A vector quantity is one that is given by an ordered pair or, more generally, an ordered n-tuple. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Velocity is a vector quantity; an object s velocity is given an ordered pair of numbers, one corresponding to speed, the other to direction. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Mass, temperature, density, viscosity, pressure, speed, conductivity, and malleability are all scalar quantities. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Even though a piece of paper is a four-dimensional object, it is a one-dimensional object qua thing that has a length. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Two objects have the same length if they are length-congruent. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Two objects are length-congruent if (but, given that there are many ways to establish length-congruence, not only if) two conditions are met, namely: (i) When juxtaposed, each endpoint of the one is contiguous one of the endpoints of the other, and (ii) The distance between those two objects is constant---it doesn t wax and wane. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | L is longer than L* if L* is congruent with a proper segment of L. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Absent a definition of congruence, L is longer than L* and L and L* are length-identical are devoid of meaning. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Absent a definition of length-congruence, no object L can be a length-standard. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | For L to be a length-standard, it must be said what it is for L* to be length-identical with L. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Given some L-congruent object L*, L* is capable of serving as a length-standard. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | It may turn out that, if L* is assumed to be length-constant, conditions (i)-(iii) are satisfied, but that aleph same conditions are violated if L is assumed to be length-constant. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Length-congruence holds between one-dimensional objects; triangle-congruence holds between two-dimensional objects; pyramid-congruence holds between three-dimensional objects. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | For any integer n, there are (hypothetical, if not actual) n-dimensional objects and, consequently, n-dimensional congruence. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A given object is provisionally taken as a length-standard. A congruence-relation is defined. On that basis, other objects are measured. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Those measurements yield knowledge of physical laws. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Small distances can be measured using meter rods, and they can also be measured using light rays. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Large distances can be measured using light rays, but they cannot be measured using meter-rods. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Within narrow horizons, meter-rod measurements and optical measurements yield the same results. This is a contingent fact. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Suppose it turned out---as it well might have---that the numbers yielded by meter-rod measurements could not be coordinated with the numbers yielded by optical measurements. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | In that case, there would be no one magnitude that was measured in both ways, and statements to the effect that the Sun is n meters from the Earth would be meaningless. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | One can use a thermometer to measure the temperature of bath water. One cannot use a thermometer to measure the temperature of magma, let alone the temperature of a star. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | On the basis of thermometer-based measurements, one acquires knowledge of low-level physical laws (e.g. that such and such metals have such and such coefficients of expansion). | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | On the basis of this knowledge, one acquires knowledge of higher-level physical laws (e.g. that radiation-intensity varies inversely with the square of the distance from the heat-source). | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Day-to-day experience gives us approximate metrical knowledge, on the basis of which we can identify correlations on the basis of which we can obtain hitherto unobtainable metrical data. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | On the basis of this metrical data, we can identify precise laws, on the basis of which we can both add to and refine such metrical knowledge as we already have. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Two meter-rods can be laid side by side. Non-simultaneous events cannot be laid side by side. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If it is to be known how two such events compare in respect of duration, one must know of some periodic process that occurred during each event and, further, one must know how many installments of that processes occurred during each. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If m installments of that process occur during the one event and n installments occur during the other, then, if that process is indeed a perfectly regular one, the length of the one relative to the other is n/m. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | But it cannot be said, it will be objected, that a given periodic process is regular unless there is already a way of determining duration. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | And there is no way of determining duration except in relation to some periodic process. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Therefore, some periodic process must be stipulated to be perfectly regularity: it must be perfectly regular by convention. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | This position, duly generalized, is known as conventionalism. Conventionalism is false. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If duration is measured in terms of a process that is intuitively known to be erratic (e.g. somebody s heartbeat), the resulting measurements aren t consistent with one another. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Duration-measurements are consistent with one another if duration is measured in terms of a process that is intuitively known to be regular (e.g. the series of roundtrips made by a light beam between two mirrors whose distance from each other is fixed). | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Given that, relative to a given framework, an event cannot have distinct durations, it follows that conventionalism is false. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | An extensive magnitude is one such that the degree to which a given object has that magnitude exceeds the degree to any given one of its parts has that magnitude. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | An additive magnitude is one such that the degree to which a given object has that magnitude is the arithmetical sum of the extent to which each of its parts has that magnitude. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Length and mass are extensive, and within limits they are both additive. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Speed is extensive and, within limits, additive. Intelligence is intensive. So are temperature and density. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Given any framework F, the speed of light relative to F is c (?186,000 miles/second). | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A consequence---actually, the very essence of Special Relativity---is that there is no optical test by means of which one determine whether or not one is moving. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If speed were additive, these statements would be counterlogical. But speed, though extensive, is not additive. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If you are moving at a rate of 30 mph on a train that is moving in the same direction at a rate of 30 mph, your speed relative to the train station is less than 60 mph. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A corollary is that length is non-additive. A corollary of this corollary is that volume is not additive. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If a given object s length is given by an irrational number, that object s length cannot be established by measuring that object. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Nonetheless, it can be known that a given object s length is given by such a number. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | According to many (e.g. Russell, Poincar , Einstein), this entails that, in taking LS to be length-constant, we are simply adopting a convention, not registering a fact. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Since it is entirely a matter of convention whether a given object is such a standard, the laws of nature are determined by our conventions. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Thus, conventionalism is ambiguous. Sometimes it refers to metrical conventionalism, and sometimes it refers to nomic conventionalism. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Supposing arguendo that conventionalism is correct, it doesn t follow that the laws of nature are entirely a matter of convention. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Let strict conventionalism be the position that the laws of nature are entirely a matter of convention. Strict conventionalism isn t a form of conventionalism. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If the laws of nature were convention-determined, as opposed to merely convention-based, there would be no need to take measurements to identify those laws. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A system of measurement must yield consistent results: if, relative to a given metrical standard, a given object (at a given time, relative to a given framework) both has, and does not have, a given length n, then that standard cannot coherently be used. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | It is an empirical fact that, when objects that we intuitively regard as length-variable (e.g. eels, cylinder-shaped balloons) that are used as length-standards, the resulting measurements are inconsistent with one another. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | It is also an empirical fact that, when objects that we intuitively regard as length-constant are used as length-standards (e.g. platinum rods in temperature controlled rooms), the resulting measurements are consistent with each other to a high degree of approximation. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Given that n=n, for any n, and given that use of an eel standard constitutes a rejection of this truism, whereas use of an optical standard constitutes acceptance of it, it must be said that, if eel-based measurements yield one set of physical laws and optics-based measurement yields a different set of laws, the latter are the laws that govern nature and the former are not. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Some knowledge is direct; some is indirect. Indirect knowledge is knowledge that is acquired through inference. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | To make an inference is to form a new belief on the basis of an old one. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Inferences, when legitimate, are made in accordance with legitimate rules of inference. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Rules of inference, when legitimate, correspond to dependence-relations. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | There are two kinds of dependence-relations: logical and causal. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Logical dependence-relations hold among propositions. A proposition is a truth or a falsehood. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | The proposition that x is a triangle cannot be true unless the proposition that x has three sides is true. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Therefore, x s being a triangle depends on x s having three sides. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Causal relations hold among states of affairs, not truths and falsehoods. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Smith cannot pass the class unless Smith studies. Therefore, Smith s passing depends on his studying. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | The objects of knowledge are propositions. It isn't known unless it's believed and it isn't believed unless it's a proposition. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | One can be aware of non-propositions, e.g. rocks, trees, people, but one does not in the relevant sense know them. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Rather, one knows truths about them. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Some dependence-relations are known, not through sensory observation, but through conceptual analysis. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Such truths are analytic, as opposed to empirical. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Analytic knowledge is always knowledge of dependence-relations. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Empirical knowledge can be either direct or indirect; the same is true of analytic knowledge. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Knowledge is conceptually articulated awareness. In order for me to know that my shoes are uncomfortably tight, I need to have the concepts shoe, tight, discomfort, etc. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | I do not need to have these concepts---or, arguably, any concepts---to be aware of the uncomfortable tightness in my shoes. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | My knowledge of that truth is a conceptualization of my awareness of that state of affairs. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | There are two kinds of awareness: propositional and objectual. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | My visual perception of the dog in front of me is a case of objectual awareness, as is my awareness of the tightness of my shoes. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | My knowledge that there is a dog in front of me is a case of proposition-awareness, as is my knowledge that my shoes are uncomfortably tight. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Observations are objectual awarenesses. The contents of such awarenesses must be converted into propositions if they are to be explained. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | This is because it is truths that are explained, and truths are true propositions. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | To explain some avalanche or lightning-bolt x is to explain why it is a truth that x occurred. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Causal relations can be known only through one s senses (through sight, touch, etc.) and through real-time awareness of one s own psychological processes. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | In other words, causal relations can only be known empirically; and knowledge of them is therefore empirical. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Theoretical truths are necessarily known through inference, and knowledge of such truths is therefore inferential. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | But not all inferential knowledge is theoretical knowledge. I notice that you look tired and on that basis know that you didn't get enough sleep. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | A theory is given by a proposition that, if true, describes some relatively comprehensive fact about the structure of the universe. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Theoretical knowledge is either (i) Knowledge of such a theory (e.g. your knowledge of evolutionary theory) or (ii) Knowledge that is derived from knowledge of such a theory. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | If you know it, then (i) You believe it, (ii) It is true, and (iii) Your reasons for believing it are legitimate. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | At the same time, given only that it's true and that you are justified in believing it, it doesn't follow that you know it. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | If your belief that it's noon is based on the read-out of a broken clock, it isn't knowledge, even if that clock happens to be right and, in addition, you know it to be relatively reliable. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Your belief would have been knowledge had you acquired it by virtue of being en rapport with the relevant realities; and the reason it wasn't knowledge is that it was not so acquired. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | For you to be en rapport with those realities is for you to be linked to them by structures that are information-transmissive, as opposed to merely evidence-generative. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Causal necessity is different from logical necessity. Given that x is a triangle, it is logically necessary that x have three sides. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Given that x is an ice-cube that was just placed on a very hot surface, it is causally necessary that x begin to melt. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | One state of affairs e is evidence of another state of affairs e* iff (if and only if) e and e* are causally related in such a way that, if one knows of e s existence, one has reason to believe in e* existence. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | If one knows that Smith is coughing up green phlegm, one has reason to believe that Smith has a lung infection. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Therefore, Smith s coughing up phlegm is evidence of Smith s having a lung infection. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | S is a causal series if S consists of events e1 en such that, for any i (1?i?n), ei is the cause of ei+1. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | All information is evidence, but not all evidence is information. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | The elevator s stopping at the 5th floor is evidence of somebody s pushing a certain elevator-related button. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | But neither event bears information about the other, owing to the fact that, since they have different structures, the first didn t transmit its structure to the second. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Our sense-perceptions are isomorphs of the objects they represent: the latter transmit their structures to the former. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | A perception-like experience is veridical, and therefore a bona fide perception, just in case it inherits its structure from its object, and accurate to the extent that it does so. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | It is only to the extent that our sense-perceptions, taken both individually and collectively, inherit the structures of their external counterparts that our perception-based beliefs are accurate. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | It is only to the extent that our beliefs are linked by information-transmissive series to the corresponding realities that those beliefs are knowledge. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | A testimony-based belief is knowledge only if the testimony in question is constitutive of an information-transmissive link to the externality in question. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | A belief based on the testimony of a dishonest person is knowledge, so long as the testimony in question was information-transmissive. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | A belief based on the testimony of an honest person is not knowledge unless the testimony in question was information-transmissive. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | For one event e to precede another event e* is for there to be a possible causal process beginning with e and ending with e*. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | For e and e* to be simultaneous is for there to be no such process. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Effects are continuations of their causes. An event transmits information about its cause to the extent that the former inherits its structure from the latter. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Knowledge is initially acquired through information-transmission series---our thoughts inherit their structures from our perceptions, which inherit their structures from the corresponding externalities. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | On the basis of this knowledge, we can acquire knowledge of non-information-transmissive evidential relations. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | But knowledge of the latter kind presupposes knowledge of the former kind. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
Kuczynski | Each of (a) and (c) supports predictions and counterfactuals; (b) does not do so, and neither does an accidental, albeit place- and time-invariant, generalization, such as (d) nothing in any region of space-time that is made of solid gold weighs exactly n oz., for an appropriate value of n. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | The difference between (a) and (c) is one of degree: (a) is more approximate than (c) and (a) also has less scope than (c). | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | In order to discover the structure of the world, we must organize the data at our disposal; and in order to organize the data at our disposal, we need to use principles, such as (a), that are of limited scope and are only approximately true. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | But were that condition met, there won t be any need for science; and so long as it isn t met, principled but defeasible generalizations, like (a), are to be co-categorized with principled, non-defeasible generalizations, like (c), i.e. they are to categorized as laws of nature. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | With every increase in our knowledge, there is a change in what there is to know about the world, given that any given instance of knowledge is no less a constituent of the world than is a rock or a chair. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Therefore, attempts to plug up the holes in our knowledge of the world create new such holes, it being the purpose of science, not to eliminate such holes, but to minimize their number and to restrict the scope of those cannot be eliminated. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | The difference between (a) x is human?x is cyanide-intolerant and (b) x is human?x is shellfish-intolerant is not to be understood in statistical terms. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | It is inherent in what it is to be physiologically human (or otherwise mammalian) that a human being be cyanide intolerant. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | The reason that no one is cyanide-tolerant is that a person s being cyanide-intolerant is rooted in his having a distinctively mammalian physiological make- up. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Laws of nature are not perfect concomitances: for it to be a law of nature that instances of phi bring about instances of psi is not for each and every phi to be followed by an instance of psi. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | For there to be such a law is for instances of phi to be dispositive, for reasons of a relatively non-context-specific nature, of the occurrence of instances of psi. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | If x causes y, then x and y are events. They are not are not rocks, trees, or snowmen. They are not things, in other words, at least not in the sense in which we will use that word. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Though not themselves causes or effects, things have causal properties. The rock weighs three lbs.; and it is in virtue of this fact about the rock that certain events involving the rock have certain effects. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Conditions, e.g. Smith s having high blood pressure, can be causes and effects. This is because conditions are event-pluralities and therefore events in their own right. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | For your metabolic condition to remain unchanged is for the various events constitutive of it to continue to occur within certain limits; it is for your heart to continue to beat at a certain rate; it is for the cells composing your body to be duly oxygenated at regular intervals; etc. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | For the room s temperature to remain constant is not for the various particles involved to undergo no change. It is for the changes that they are constantly undergoing to remain within certain limits; it is for those changes to remain such that their mean kinetic energy doesn t change. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | An event is a change. Therefore, all causes and all effects are changes. But we take for granted, and thus cease to be aware of, the occurrence of the changes constitutive of stable conditions; and we thus tend to reserve the use of the word change for changes in patterns of change. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Scientific knowledge enables us to explain past events and to predict future ones, and it thereby enables us, within limits, to control the course of events. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | In contexts in which there are stable patterns of events, it tends to be possible to explain, predict, and control what happens; and it tends to be impossible to do so in contexts in which there are no such patterns and which therefore consist of rogue events. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Given some event En, En s program-cause is a structure or stable condition that, although not by itself determinative of En, predetermines the occurrence of some structure- internal specific event En-1 that is thus determinative. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Freud correctly says that, if a given person X succumbs to a given psychology malady M, four different kinds of causes are likely to be operative: (1) X s precondition (how X was before he was afflicted with M); (2) M s specific cause (the trauma that, though it did not itself suffice for X s succumbing to M, made it inevitable that the slightest disturbance in X s condition would thus suffice); (3) M s concurrent cause (some trauma experienced by X, e.g. a recent break-up, that is operative independently of (2) and isn t constitutive of X s precondition); (4) The immediate or precipitating cause of M (some specific event, e.g. the sound of a car backfiring, that pushes X, who has thus far been on the threshold that separates those who suffer from X from those who don t, just past that threshold). | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | When Freud says that a given psychological event e is overdetermined, he means that it was brought about by the confluence of two or more psychological events each of which justified e s occurrence. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Thus, if Freud was right, as he surely was, causation in the psychological sphere often involves the exceeding of thresholds: it isn t enough that x have just one reason for falling in love with y; unless he has several reasons, nothing happens; but once enough such reasons accumulate, the damn bursts and x falls in love with y. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Discontinuous changes tend to involve threshold effects. A circuit breaker doesn t do anything until there is electricity-overload, at which point it shuts off the electrical pathway in question. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | To the extent that the world changes discontinuously, it has a digital structure, and to the extent that it changes continuously, it has an analogue structure. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | It follows that e was an insufficient but non-redundant part of a condition that unnecessary but sufficient for e* s occurrence that, in other words, that e was an INUS condition for e*. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Statements of the form if P had been the case, then Q would have been the case are counterfactual conditionals (or counterfactuals). | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Thus, many counterfactuals are to the effect that one thing caused another to happen and many counterfactuals therefore hold in virtue of dependence-relations of the causal variety. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | But some counterfactuals hold in virtue of dependence-relations, not of the causal, but of the logical variety. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Thus, all counterfactuals affirm the existence of instances of necessitation of some kind or other, and all therefore counterfactuals therefore hold in virtue of dependence-relations of one kind or other. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | According to David Lewis (1972, 1984), the meaning of (1) is (1#) If w is a world in which Kennedy was not assassinated but is otherwise as much like our world as that fact allows it to be, then in w the US pulled out of Viet Nam before 1965. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | This means that counterfactuals hold in virtue of the logical and causal structure of our world, as opposed to other worlds. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Given that the cause of an event is what guarantees its occurrence, the boiling of the water is, insofar as it guaranteed the occurrence of the likes of c1 cn, appropriately described as the cause of the cracking of the vessel. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | In general, where there is causal redundancy, causal truths cannot be converted into counterfactual truths. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | According to CAC, the meaning of (#) e is the cause of e* is (#*) If e hadn t happened, then e* wouldn t have happened. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | Ordinarily the meaning of (#) is taken to be (#^) e compelled e* to occur, i.e. e s occurrence necessitated e* s occurrence. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | CAC is meant to provide one such way of reinterpreting causal claims. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | A theory is extensionally correct if there are no counterexamples to it. A theory is intensionally correct if, first, there are no counterexamples to it and, second, the reason there are no counterexamples to it is that it is a correct description of what it's supposed to describe. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | CAC is extensionally false. For (#*) If e hadn t happened, then e* wouldn t have happened is not always consequence of (#) e is the cause of e*. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | CAC is also intensionally false. Suppose it true both that (A) The otherwise unthreatened bird died because Smith shot it and also consequently that (A*) if Smith hadn t shot it, the bird would not have died. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
Kuczynski | In general, supposing that e is the cause of e*, it is only if e is insufficiently described that if e hadn t happened, then e* wouldn t have happened fails to be a consequence of e is the cause of e*. | Causation
Kuczynski | There are three problems with CACD. These have to do with (i) Events whose causes involve the exceeding of thresholds, (ii) Events whose causes are mechanisms that can be implemented in different ways, and (iii) Events whose causes program for their occurrence. | Causation
Kuczynski | At time t, I push the button and the elevator comes as a result. Had I not done so, someone else might have pushed the button at t and the elevator would still have come, and the result would have been the same: the elevator would have come at the same time, in the same way. | Causation
Kuczynski | The button is a binary-mechanism. When the elevator comes isn t a function of the way in which the button is pushed, and neither is the manner in which the elevator comes. | Causation
Kuczynski | Thus, had some other person pushed the button, the result would have been the very same event that resulted from my pushing the button. | Causation
Kuczynski | Therefore CACD is false, given that, according to it, the (hypothetical) event resulting from the other person s pushing the button would not have been numerically identical with the (actual) event resulting from my pushing it. | Causation
Kuczynski | In general, the identity of a given threshold effect is not contingent on the specific composition of its antecedents. Thus, where threshold effects are concerned, there is genuine causal redundancy, and CACD is therefore false. | Causation
Kuczynski | My hitting ENTER caused a 3 to appear on the LCD. But if I hadn t hit ENTER, the 3 still would have appeared, since my friend Gus would have hit ENTER had I not done so. | Causation
Kuczynski | In general, software-level activity---meaning, ultimately, any causal-series that can be implemented in different ways---is to be distinguished from the event-series by which it is implemented, notwithstanding that the two series are spatiotemporally coincident. | Causation
Kuczynski | In general, the identity an event that can be implemented in different ways isn t contingent on its exact composition or, therefore, on the exact composition of its cause. Thus, where such events are concerned, there is genuine causal redundancy, and CACD is therefore false. | Causation
Kuczynski | Given that the batter was on a hot griddle, it was inevitable that some such micro-events occur, even though it obviously wasn t inevitable that those specific micro-events occur. | Causation
Kuczynski | Therefore, if m1 mn hadn t occurred, the conversion-process still would have occurred, thanks to some entirely distinct confluence of micro-events m*1 m*m. | Causation
Kuczynski | In general, the identity of an event whose cause programs for it is not contingent on its specific composition or on the precise identity of its immediate antecedents. Thus, where such events are concerned, there is genuine causal redundancy, and CACD is therefore false. | Causation
Kuczynski | According to CAC, e is the cause of e* iff e* wouldn t have happened had e not happened. Frankfurt s proves that CAC is false. | Causation
Kuczynski | My pushing the button is the cause of the elevator s coming, but the elevator might have come even if I hadn t pushed the button somebody else might have pushed it. Therefore, CAC is false. | Causation
Kuczynski | According to Hume, e1 is the direct cause of e2 iff any event that is similar to e1 spatially adjacent to an immediately posterior event that is similar to e2; and e1 is the indirect cause of en iff, for each i (1?i?n), any event that is similar to ei spatially adjacent to an immediately posterior event that is similar to ei+1. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume holds that, if e is the direct cause of e*, then there is a law to the effect that any event similar to e is adjacent to an immediately posterior event that is similar to e*. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume therefore holds that laws are regularities and causal sequences are instances of such regularities. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume therefore rejects the conventional view, according to which laws are structures that are responsible for such regularities and are therefore distinct from them. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume therefore rejects the conventional view, according to which causes are responsible for their effects and are therefore not merely their antecedents. | Causation
Kuczynski | If there is any empirical (observational) basis for saying that e caused e*, it is (i) The fact that e was e* s immediate predecessor and neighbor, coupled with (ii) The fact that events similar to e are always the immediate predecessors and neighbors of events similar to e*. | Causation
Kuczynski | There are two kinds of causal processes: (i) Those that involve interactions and (ii) Those that consist solely of instances of persistence. | Causation
Kuczynski | Following Bertrand Russell, we will refer to type-(i) causation as transeunt causation and to type-(ii) causation as immanent causation. | Causation
Kuczynski | Anything that endures for any length of time is a series of instances of immanent causation and is thus a causal series: a series of states of affairs such that any given such state, apart from the last, is the cause of a structurally similar such state and any such state, apart from the first, is the effect of a similar such state. | Causation
Kuczynski | The difference between immanent and transeunt causation is that immanent causation is, whereas transeunt causation is not, structure-preserving. | Causation
Kuczynski | Any given case of transeunt causation involves the cessation of a structure-preserving causal series. | Causation
Kuczynski | The essence of transeunt causation is the discontinuous alteration of object-constitutive causal-series. | Causation
Kuczynski | The essence of transeunt causation is discontinuity. The essence of immanent causation is continuity. | Causation
Kuczynski | A consequence is that the world has a digital structure to the extent that it hosts instances of transeunt causation, and an analogue structure to the extent that it hosts instances of immanent causation. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume takes it for granted that all instances of causation are identical with such disruptions, and Hume therefore takes it for granted that those continuities per se are non-causal. | Causation
Kuczynski | Because Hume took breakdowns of causal cohesiveness as instances of such cohesiveness, he believed causation to be a relation between disjoint entities. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hume claims that there is no empirical basis for preferring (a) e made e* happen to (b) e*-similar events always follow immediately antecedent neighboring e-similar events. | Causation
Kuczynski | Given that the actual and the hypothetical situations are observationally indistinguishable, it follows that no causal nexus linking cause and effect can be observed in the actual situation. | Causation
Kuczynski | In general, genuine causal processes are observationally distinguishable from pseudo-causal processes. And what observation reveals is that the events composing a genuine causal sequence are continuous with each other, whereas those events composing a pseudo-causal sequence are merely contiguous with each other, effects are continuous with their causes, and not merely contiguous with them. | Causation
Kuczynski | These points suggest that the essence of causation is continuity: a continuous event-series is a causal process; a discontinuous event-series is a non-causal process, even if every non-terminal member of that sequence is contiguous with its success and every non-initial member is contiguous with its predecessor. | Causation
Kuczynski | The temporal order is to be understood in terms of the causal order, not vice versa. Hume's analysis assumes otherwise and is therefore viciously circular and therefore false. | Causation
Kuczynski | Correlation is not causation. A consequence of Hume s analysis---indeed, the very essence of it---is that correlation is causation. Therefore, Hume s analysis is false. | Causation
Kuczynski | Given any spatiotemporally adjacent events, e and e*, there is some regularity of which that event-sequence is an instance. Hume s analysis therefore entails that any two spatiotemporally adjacent events are related as cause and effect. Since this isn t the case, Hume s analysis is incorrect. | Causation
Kuczynski | There is no way to assign relative dates or positions to events except on the basis of their causal interrelations. | Causation
Kuczynski | Truths about spatiotemporal interrelations are therefore truths about causal interrelations, and the spatiotemporal order is to be understood in terms of the causal order. Hume assumes otherwise, and his analysis is therefore incorrect. | Causation
Kuczynski | Epiphenomenal causation is not actual causation; it is pseudo-causation. e is the epiphenomenal cause of e* iff (i) Any e-similar event is immediately succeeded by an adjacent e*-similar event, (ii) e is not the cause of e*, and (iii) The cause of each of e and e* is some underlying causal mechanism e#. | Causation
Kuczynski | Reality abounds with instances of epiphenomenal causation. If a thermometer is immersed in hot water, the upward-movement of the column of mercury immediately precedes an adjacent acceleration of the particles composing the walls of the thermometer. But the former is not the cause of the latter; the cause of each is the fact that the thermometer in hot water. | Causation
Kuczynski | Computers are structured in such a way that bona fide causal processes are mirrored by pseudo-causal causal processes. Visible desktops operations are manifestations of invisible software activity. | Causation
Kuczynski | According to DN, E is explained iff, supposing that C is a description of the circumstances in which E occurred and L is a description of the laws operative in C, then the proposition that E occurred is a logical consequence of the conjunction of C and L. | Causation
Kuczynski | Laws are given by propositions that support counterfactuals. Increasing gas-temperature increases gas-volume is a law because, other things being equal, the greater the gas s temperature, the greater the volume it occupies. | Causation
Kuczynski | Hempel s proposal (widely accepted among DN-advocates, since they have no other choice) is this: whereas metal expands when heated supports counterfactuals, all the coins in JM s pocket are quarters does not. | Causation
Kuczynski | Thus, a law is a generalization that supports counterfactuals. In this way, DN has seemingly insulated itself against the charge that nomic statements express causal relations and therefore against the consequent charge that DN is wrong to hold that explanations are categorically law-based. | Causation
Kuczynski | Counterfactuals are cryptocausal statements; to know causes is to know explanations; to explain an event is to identify its cause. Therefore, DN is guilty of vicious circular in so far as its legitimacy is predicated on laws being counterfactual supporting. | Causation
Kuczynski | it follows that explanations are not, at least not in general, law-based and, more precisely, that they do not, at least not in general, have the form to explain E is to identify known laws L1 Ln such that, if C1 Cm is a description of the antecedents of E, then E is a logical consequence of L1 Ln+C1 Cm. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | According to Hempel, if we want to know that the rope snapped, we need to know (i) What the conditions were that obtained prior to the rope s snapping, and (ii) What the natural laws were in virtue of which those conditions led to the rope s snapping. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | when Hempel tells us that E is to be explained in terms of the conditions preceding it, what Hempel means, assuming it true, is that the rope-snapping is a consequence of the relevant preconditions (e.g. the integrity of the rope, the weight of the suspended object, the distance of that object from the body that is dragging it downward, the density of that body). | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | We can t provide a deductive-nomological explanation of E unless we know, for each E s infinitely many preconditions, whether or not that precondition is relevant to E; and if we know a given precondition C is relevant to E, then we ipso facto know that C caused E, and, since to explain an event is to identify its cause, we ipso facto have an explanation of E. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Thus, in order to provide a deductive-nomological explanation of E, we must already have an explanation of E. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | For me to have a high-resolution understanding of why E happened, I do indeed know the how, and not just the what. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | For me to know why Smith is sick it is not enough for me to know what made him sick (he ate rotten fish); I also need to know how his eating rotten fish led to his being ill. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | But if I know, as I surely can, that Smith is sick because he ate rotten fish, I surely do have knowledge of an explanation of his condition, even though that explanation is low-resolution. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Similarly, if I know what led to the rope s snapping (it was made of bubble gum and there was a heavy ball attached to it), I am surely aware of a correct explanation of the rope-snapping. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If I know which laws were involved, then I surely have a much better explanation of that same event: I have a scientific explanation of that event, whereas I previously did not. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Earlier it was pointed out that we seem to know of individual cases of metal s being heated and expanding for that reason before we know of the law in virtue of which heated metals expand: indeed, a precondition for our knowing of such a law seems to be that we know of individual cases of metal expanding in consequence of being heated. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | We see many cases of metal objects being heated and then expanding. We are puzzled. So we posit a law L to the effect that metal expands when heated. Now that we (think we) know of this law, we are no longer puzzled. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | You say that we can t know of L s existence until we know of individual cases of metal objects expanding in consequence of being heated. This is not correct. We know of metal objects expanding upon heated. But until we know of L, we don t know that there to be a cause-effect relationship between those objects being heated and their expanding. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If our only reason for thinking that x expands when heated is that x does expand when heated, then in positing a law to the effect that they are causally connected, all we are doing is saying: 'It is so; for it must be so.' | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | In which case, L doesn t really explain anything. And in which case, furthermore, there is insufficient evidence for L, a consequence being that L isn t really a law so much as it is a tentative hypothesis, which, being of questionable veridicality, cannot serve as the basis of an explanation. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | By the same token, if we have good reason to believe L to be a law, we must have reason to believe, independently of L, that this particular piece of metal expanded because it was heated, the same being true of that piece of metal piece, and also of that other piece of metal, and so on. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Physical laws as regularities of proportion Threshold effects aside, effects are proportional to their causes. This has several consequences, none of them consistent with RA or with DN. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | First of all, laws are not expressed by regularities. A collision may or may not displace an object. It may be destroy it. It may not destroy it, but may fail to make it budge. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If conditions are held constant, then events that are identical in respect of momentum or temperature (or whatever the relevant parameters are) have the same effects, in which case causal relations are expressed by regularities. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Second, to the extent that laws are expressed by regularities, they are expressed by regularities of proportion: volume increases directly proportional to temperature increases; gravitational attraction is proportional to the masses of the bodies in question. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | So if indeed causal nexuses are regularities, they aren t regularities of the form e-similar events always precede e*-similar events. They are regularities of proportion and are therefore regularities of a much more abstract kind than those that the DN-advocate has in mind. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | But circumstances don't remain constant, and they don't have to remain constant for us to learn what causes what. Events are changes. The greater the change, the greater then effect. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | As long as we can correlate input-differences with output-differences, we can establish causality. A corollary is that a singular events are the effects of a singular antecedent, and, when given a singular event, we know its cause as soon as we identify a singularity among its antecedents. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Do such dalliances always lead to venereal disease, or even most of the time? No. Does it matter? No. You know of some event predating your malady that is as singular as your malady. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | And this proves the point at hand, that, when e is known to be the cause of e*, it isn t because e-e* is an instance of a perfect regularity; it s because, of e* s various antecedents, e is the only one that is proportional to e*. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Given that we can know what causes a given event without knowing of any law L that links cause and effect, it follows, given that to explain an event is to identify its cause, that we can sometimes explain events without explaining them in terms of laws. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | To explain an event in detail is to explain how the specifics of the event depended on the specifics of the cause, and for that we do need laws. We need laws if we are to have scientific explanations. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | But scientific explanations presuppose prescientific explanations. We must distinguish between non-explanations and pre-scientific explanations. Non-explanations are not pre-scientific explanations. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If my explanation of the fact that I burnt my hand is that I touched a hot surface, my explanation is correct, but not scientific. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If it is always so obvious what causes what, why do scientists bother with tests? Why do they repeat the same experiment over and over? | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Scientific tests have a number of functions. First of all, people s causal beliefs aren t always correct. This is partly due to the fact that, as was pointed out in class, a given event may have a number of equally salient antecedents. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Another reason is that experiments identify specific information about causes that is not easy to come by in non-experimental settings. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | If e is the cause of e*, e precedes e*. Given that no event is instantaneous, this means that each takes time to occur and, therefore, that it takes time for both of them to occur. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Thus, given any non-null time-interval, interval-initial circumstances of a given kind are compatible with interval-terminal circumstances of many different kinds. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Therefore, instances of causation are not instances of regularity. For e to be the cause of e* is not for e-similar events to always precede e*-similar events. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | It follows that laws are not regularities. It also follows that laws are not forces or structures that are responsible for regularities. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | According to Hume, we know that e causes e* because (i) e immediately precedes, and is adjacent with, e*, and (ii) e-similar events always immediately precede adjacent e*-similar events. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | This is not typically how we learn what causes what. If it is known that, apart from being collided with by ball A, hitherto stationary ball B was in a state of equilibrium, then it is known that the collision was necessarily the cause the change in B s state of motion. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Thus, if we know that e is the cause of e*, it isn t necessarily because we have observed some regularity of which that event-sequence (e followed by e*) is an instance. In many cases, there is no such regularity. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | It may be that, unless one has knowledge of laws, one cannot know why a given event followed some other event. But without knowledge of laws one can obviously know that the first event was indeed the cause of the second. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | Hume seems to have thought that, unless it is known why the collision caused the hitherto stationary ball to move---unless Newton s second law of motion is known, along with A s momentum at the time of the collision and B s mass it cannot be known that the collision is the cause of its moving. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | To know what caused an event is to know how to explain it. I can explain your tantrum: I insulted you. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
Kuczynski | This shows that, contrary to what DN assumes, not all explanations are law-based. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | In some cases we know that e causes e*, and we are therefore know a (low-resolution but otherwise) correct explanation of the latter, even though we don t know of any law that connects the two events. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | It also shows that knowledge of (low-level but otherwise) correct explanations of facts is a prerequisite to knowledge of natural law. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | In order to learn Newton s second law (the acceleration of an object depends directly upon the net force acting upon that object and indirectly on the object s mass), one must know that certain collisions are responsible for certain displacements. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | If one doesn t know this, then one a fortiori doesn t know that among the (invariably very numerous) laws determinative of the exact nature of the accelerations of the displaced objects, one of them is that the acceleration of the displaced object is inversely proportional to its mass and directly proportional the net force acting on it. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | One quite glaring failure of DN concerns its treatment of psychological explanations. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | If DN is right, as Hempel makes clear, not a single one of the psychological explanations ever put forth identifies the cause of any psychological event. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | If DN is right, I don t know that my insult is the cause of your tantrum unless I know of some perfect regularity of which that event-sequence is an instance. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Outside of physics and chemistry, any such regularities as are to be found are imperfect. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | And a consequence of DN, therefore, is that, outside of those two disciplines, nothing has ever been explained. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | It may well be that nobody knows the complete explanation of any given psychological event. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | But a consequence of DN is that, pending the discovery of some perfect regularity of which the insult-tantrum event-sequence was an instance, it simply isn t known whether or not the insult was in any way, to any degree, the cause of the tantrum. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | The cause of many a psychological event is known, even though the corresponding regularity, if there is one, is not known; and if the corresponding regularity is known, it isn t necessarily implicated in one s knowledge of the relevant event-sequence. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | You may well know that people who are dumped feel sadness. But it isn t on the basis of this knowledge that you know that the reason you are sad is that you were dumped. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | DN entails that, unless you know of some regularity of which your writing this fugue is an instance, you cannot possibly know that your doing so is a consequence of your being dumped. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | DN also entails that, unless people who are dumped always respond by trying to impress their exes, no person s attempting to rekindle his/her ex s affections through a heroic deed is a consequence of him/her being dumped by said ex---which is false---and a fortiori it cannot be known of some particular act of valor performed by some dumped person that his/her heroic deed is a consequence of him/her being dumped---also false. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Hempel acknowledges that perfect regularities often are not available. And he says that, in such cases, one must rely on imperfect regularities: regularities of the form e-similar events usually precede e*-similar events. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | The probability that an insult will elicit a tantrum is small: most insults do not result in tantrums. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | And supposing that 95% of insults were followed by tantrums, there would not, at least not for that reason, be a statistical law to the effect that 95% of tantrums follow insults; for it might not be that the tantrums in question were consequences of the antecedent insults. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | In general, supposing that most phi s are followed by psi s, it doesn t follow that phi s cause psi s, even part of the time, or a fortiori that there is a statistical law to the effect that n% of phi s cause (or are followed by) phi s (for some n>50). | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | But that isn t because they re in a swimming pool; it s because (in most cases) they re in a public place. They are often, presumably, wearing bathing gear despite being in a swimming pool. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Contrariwise, given only that 30% of phi s are followed by psi s, it doesn t follow that phi s don t cause psi s. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Smoking causes emphysema; but only emphysema occurs in less than 30% of people who smoke the requisite amount (the amount the emphysemics smoked, at least before they got emphysema). | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | What is true of emphysemics is that the only distinctive thing about their behavior was that they were heavy smokers. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | But the statistical relevance model, being nothing more than a watered down version of the Deductive nomological model, has the latter s defects but not its virtues; and it s not really worth running the diagnostics on this obviously degenerate and degenerating research program. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | DN doesn t hold with respect to all explanations; it isn t possible to give deductive nomological explanations of events until it is known what is causally relevant; and to the extent that one knows what is causally relevant to what, one already has knowledge explanations. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | So far as DN is correct, it s a correct description of scientific explanation, a scientific explanation of E being one that says both (i) What made E happen and (ii) How it did so. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | As a matter of logic, sentences that are logically equivalent must be confirmationally equivalent, but there are logically equivalent sentences that are not confirmationally equivalent (e.g. all ravens are black and all non-black things are non-ravens ). | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Logical equivalence: S1 and S2 are logically equivalent iff S1 entails S2 and S2 entails S1. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Confirmational equivalence: S1 and S2 are confirmationally equivalent iff, given any datum D, D confirms S1 to degree n iff D confirms S2 to degree n. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | It follows, by an indirect proof, that logical equivalence entails confirmational equivalence. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Consider: R1: All ravens are black (if x is a raven, then x is black), and R2: All non-black things are non-ravens (if x is non-black, then x isn t a raven). R1 and R2 are equivalent. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Consider: R3: x is a pink piano. R3 confirms R2, but not R1. The pinkness of pianos has nothing to do with the blackness of ravens. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Consider: M1: Heated metal expands (if x is metal, then x expands when heated), and M2: Heated non-expanders aren t metal (if x doesn t expand when heated, then x isn t metal). The equivalence of M1 and M2 is easily verified using Venn diagrams. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Consider: M3: Cube steaks shrink when heated. M3 confirms M2, but not M1: The deflationary tendencies of heated meat have nothing to do with the expansionary tendencies of heated metal. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Hempel s solution R3 does confirm R1 and R2 equally. We think otherwise because, our background beliefs being what they are, we believe it impossible that pianos should be ravens. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | Similarly, M3 does confirm M1 and M2 equally. We think otherwise because, our background beliefs being what they are, we believe it impossible that cube steaks should be made of metal. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | We can t learn anything about ravens by studying pianos. We can t learn anything about metal by studying meat. Hempel s solution implies otherwise and is therefore false. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
Kuczynski | For there would be no undetectable processes---no electron-jumps, nothing too small or too remote to be observable or to have observable consequences---that, if per impossible it were known of, would be a reason to hold that U2 was a continuous of some pre-t* universe. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Operationally speaking, U1 would be as distinct from U2 as a world where Dick Cheney is president in 2014 is from our world. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Relative to U2, that is to say, U1 would simply be a hypothetical universe; and, should that hypothetical universe exist, the relation borne by it with respect to U2 is the same as the relation borne by a universe in which Cheney is president in 2014 with respect to our universe. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This doesn t mean that U1 doesn t exist. It means that, operationally speaking, it is no more a constituent of any universe of which U2 is a constituent than a 2014 Pres. Cheney Universe is a constituent of a universe of which our universe is also a constituent. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Suppose that that there are non-initial, U2-internal events e1 en that occur ex nihilo, i.e. that there are events e1 en that happen in U2 that happen after t*, the interval between them and t* between non-null, that don t have any roots in preceding U2-internal events. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | An ex nihilo event is one that has no roots in anything preceding it, its occurrence be no more favored by the preceding state of the universe than its non-occurrence. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If (1), then the post-t# space-time manifold---let U3 be this manifold---bears the same relation to U2 that U2 bears to U1, in which case, operationally speaking, U2 and U3 are no more jointly constitutive of some one space-time manifold than are U1 and U2. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If (2), then there are events e^1 e^o such that e^1 e^o precede t# and eventuate, by way of continuous processes, in post-t# events, then U3 s relationship to U2 is not the same as U2 s relationship to U1. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Under that circumstance, U2 and U3 do jointly constitute a single space-time manifold. But that does not by itself guarantee that e1 en are constituents of that manifold. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Suppose that e1 en have no effects on any events in U2 or U3. In that case, they neither cause, nor are caused by, U2-internal events or U3-internal events; and in that case, for now familiar reasons, nothing in U2-U3 has anything to do with them and, operationally speaking, e1 en don t exist as far as U2 and U3 are concerned. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Thus, the supposition that there are ex nihilo events that are U2-internal is predicated on the assumption that those events are causally connected to U2-internal events that do not occur ex nihilo. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This means that, if we know e and e* to belong to the same space-time manifold, then we know there to be some causal connection between them; we know that either (i) e causes e*; (ii) e* causes e; or (iii) some third event e# causes, or is caused by, both. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If observation apprises us of such a connection, then, as far as e and e* are concerned, we don t need to posit unobserved continuities. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If observation does not apprise us of such a connection, we do have to posit hidden continuities, since the non-existence of such continuities is incompatible with the datum that e and e* are part of the same space-time manifold. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Because we observed each and were therefore affected by each. Since causally connected events are ipso facto co-occupants of some one space-time manifold, e and e* are such co-occupants. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Suppose we posit some continuous event-series E such that e causes e* by way of E. If E actually exists, then each segment s of E that lasts for a non-null time-period must satisfy the following condition: s s existence/occurrence cannot be incompatible with that of event e! that is known to occupy the same space-time manifold as e and e*. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This means that, if e$ is the event that connects e1 to e2 and constitutes the intersection-point of the series connecting e1 and e1 and the series connecting e and e*, then e$ must be continuous with its predecessor and its successor in each of two distinct event-series. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This means that to validate the datum that two events, e and e*, are part of the same space-time manifold, it is necessary to posit unobserved events that link those two events. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | In fact, given two non-simultaneous events, in order to validate the datum that they belong to the same space-time manifold, it is necessary to posit a continuous process CP connecting them (either directly or way of some third event to which they are both related as cause/effect) such that every segment of CP is identical with the segment of each of the infinitely many event-series that intersects with CP. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Herein lies the justification for positing unobserved continuities to explain observed events in terms of other observed events. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Given only that there is a causal connection of some kind between any two co-occupants of some single manifold, how does it follow that the causal connections between past (known) events will bear any resemblance to future (or otherwise unknown) events? | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Hume s attempt to delegitimize induction presupposes that the laws of physics can just be suspended. That presupposition in its turn assumes that the laws of physics are separable from the space-time manifold; it assumes, in other words, that they are not constitutive of that manifold. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Laws are not independent of one another. In actuality, gas-pressure is directly proportional to temperature. If it were inversely proportional to temperature, every one of the laws of mechanics would have to be jettisoned or heavily modified. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If the speed of light were framework-relative, then mass and energy would no longer be capable of being converted into each other, at least not in accordance with the same laws that govern such conversions in actuality. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Also, if light did not have a framework-constant velocity, all of our metrical conventions would be thrown off. There would be no principled ways of determining position or, therefore, velocity or, therefore, rates of growth or expansion. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Thus, if at time t* the laws of physics changed, then the positions, masses, velocities, temperatures, etc. of many, if not all, of the occupants of the post-t* universe (U2) would be discontinuous from their pre-t* (U1) positions, masses, etc. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This means that, if the laws of physics changed at time t*, the result would be the obliteration of the space-time manifold---the universe---in which those laws were operative. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Different laws, different spatiotemporal manifold. Different spatiotemporal manifold, different universe. The space-time manifold isn t an empty vessel that can house different laws; it is defined by the laws that govern its occupants. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | We have already seen that, if post-t* events are discontinuous with pre-t* events, then there is no single space-time manifold that U1 and U2 jointly constitute. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This is a datum, as we have seen, because, if a given person is to know of each of two events, each of those events must have affected him; and if each of two events affects a given thing, all three things are ipso facto part of some one space-time manifold. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | According to U, the laws of physics don t change. Hume says that any assurance we have as to U s veridicality is induction-based and, therefore, that we have no such assurance. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | We know that U is true because, if it weren t, nothing would persist---literally---include the very entities that make inductive inferences. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | U is a precondition for the making of inductive inferences; so as long as makers of inductive inferences, U holds and inductive inferences either go through or, if they fail, they fail for reasons of incompetence (failure to identify the relevant parameters, failure to compute the relevant sums, etc.), and because of anything having to do with the legitimacy of inductive inference per se. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Objects (rocks, trees, stars: stable, dynamically unified event-patterns) are systems of interacting parts. The laws governing such systems would cease to exist at t. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If the laws of physics were different, there would be no electrons, since to be an electron is inter alia to be governed by certain laws. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Objects are constituted by the forces that govern them; those forces are instances of physical laws. Different laws, different forces; different forces, different objects. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Owing to the nomic changes occurring at t, there would be no sense in which anything happening before t could the cause of anything happening after t. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Thus, given that the laws of physics change at t, then there would be no space-time manifold of which both U1 and U2 were constituents, and the supposition that the laws of physics change at t is therefore tantamount to the supposition that the space-time manifold ceases to exist at t. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | This means that if there are physical laws, then, until time comes to an end, our inductive practices have a legitimate basis. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | Many inductive inferences do not concern the future; they concern what is present or past but is unknown. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If I inductively infer that, at this exact time, some object is still solid, that inference doesn t concern the future. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | If I inductively infer that, several thousand years ago, an asteroid hit a certain part of the Earth s surface, that inference obviously doesn t concern the future. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | So, provided that physical laws exist, many inductive inferences are unqualifiedly legitimate. | The Problem of Induction
Kuczynski | The fact that such precautions must be taken shows that, at any given time, what one can learn about the world is quite circumscribed; that if it s impossible to know X at time t, it may be possible to learn about X at later time t*. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | But the thesis that the universe is completely predictable requires that, for any time t, it is possible, at t, to predict how, for any later time t*, the universe will be at t*. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Laplace s thesis, it will be objected, is that a creature of infinite intelligence could predict how things will be. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Prediction requires both intelligence and knowledge, and there is no conceivable being that acquire complete knowledge of the state of the universe at any point in time. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | If one is to have a sense-perception of a given thing, there must be an information-bearing causal process linking that thing to oneself. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | In order to learn about the subatomic world, one must irradiate it, i.e. flood it with light or otherwise bombard it with radiation of some kind or another. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | But because light is composed of particles (photons) whose masses are comparable to those of the particles that the microphysicist aspires to learn about, the effect of flooding the microphysical world with light is to change it utterly. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | If you use a flame thrower to learn about a school of rodents, you will succeed up to a point: their charred remains will give you tell you a lot about them: but it won t tell you everything. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | It being inherent in the nature of sensory knowledge that it involve a causal connection between subject and object, there is no conceivable being that could have complete knowledge of the microstructure of the world. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Therefore, nothing could have complete knowledge of the conditions obtaining at t, for any time t, or, consequently, at any later time t*, given that knowledge of the future is necessarily based on the knowledge of the present. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Knowledge of the future= Knowledge of initial conditions+knowledge of laws+ The knowledge yielded by making the inferences warranted by the first two kinds of knowledge. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Supposing that such and such facts are inherently unknowable, then why grant their existence? By supposition, they might as well not exist, even if they do. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | One fact which falls within the scope of science is that, in order to learn about the world, we must interact with it. Another such fact is that interactions have effects. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Given that two facts that do fall within the scope of science entail that there are things about the world that cannot be known, it follows that, for science no less than for metaphysics, the world is to some extent unknowable. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | There has never been a single photon of which any person was aware; but we know that photons exist, since, if they didn't, the photoelectric effect could not be explained. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | No creature can possibly predict what it will come to know. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Suppose you know now, at time t, that, during the next 20 years, you will learn truths t1 tn, and no other truths. In that case you now know t1 tn and they therefore aren t what you will learn in the next 20 years. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Given that what you know affects what you do, and thus affects how the world is, it follows that no creature can know exactly what it will do or, therefore, exactly how what it will do will affect the world. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | If x and y are identical in respect of their microphysical properties, then it is inconceivable that they should differ in respect of their biological properties. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | In general, one class of facts supervenes on another class of facts exactly if there can t be a change in the former without there being a change in the latter but not vice versa. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Given two pieces of clay that are identical in respect of their strictly physical properties (e.g. their shapes, masses, etc.), it is inconceivable that they should differ in respect of their aesthetic properties. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | But aesthetic properties cannot be identified with physical (physics-related) properties. First of all, two objects that are physically different can be aesthetically identical. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | The aesthetic is thus multiply realizable with respect to the physical. The same is true, for the same reasons mutatis mutandis, of the biological. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | A biological mechanism of a given kind can be implemented by entities that are physically very different from one another. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Software is variable with respect to hardware. Software-identical systems may be hardware-distinct. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | It is said that the mental supervenes on the physiological: given two creatures that are physiologically identical, it is impossible that they should differ psychologically. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | It is incoherent to suppose that two entities that are microphysically identical should differ biologically. By contrast, it is not incoherent, though it is counternomic, to suppose that two physiologically identical creatures should differ in respect of their psychological properties. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Nothing can violate the laws of physics. There are no mass-energy displacements that are not governed by the laws of physics. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | For this reason, many have thought that everything (everything spatiotemporal, that is) can be explained in terms of the laws of physics. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | The statue is not identical with the clay of which it consists. They have different modal properties (one can destroy the statue without destroying the clay); so the clay isn t identical with the statue. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | The laws of physics tell you how those atoms behave. They don t tell you anything about the computer. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | The laws of physics don t say anything about computation, storage space, etc. Those concepts (computation, etc.) don t exist as far as those laws are concerned. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | So a physics-omniscient being does not in virtue of that fact have any computer-specific concepts and therefore does not have any computer-related knowledge. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Two software-identical units may be physically very different. So given only that x and y are software-identical, nothing can be said about their respective physical realizations. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Consequently, there is no way to map software-truths onto hardware-truths. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | The similarities in question are to be understood in terms of concepts (e.g. computation, recursion, algorithm) for which the laws of physics make no provisions. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | To the extent that x is a computer---to the extent that x is something that implements a program---x is a deterministic system. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | It is only to the extent that x is failing to implement a program that x is indeterministic. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Given only that biologically identical inputs may be followed by biologically distinct outputs, it doesn t follow that the laws (if any there be) of biology are indeterministic or probabilistic. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Supposing that the laws of physics are indeterministic, it doesn t follow that higher-order laws are indeterministic. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Supposing arguendo that the laws of microphysics are indeterministic, it doesn t follow that aggregates of microparticles behave indeterministically, for the reason that the various norm-non-compliant behaviors on the part of individual particles cancel one another out. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Statistics are evidence of probabilities; statistics are not themselves probabilities. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | According to FT, statistics are identical with probabilities; therefore, FT is false. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Also, statistics are only as truth-conducive as they are consistent with the causal mechanisms that generate them. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | When it is said that that probability of a computer-malfunction is greater than 0%, the statement being made is to be interpreted causally, not statistically. | Determinism and Natural Laws
Kuczynski | Measuring an object s length involves assigning a real number to its length: same length, same number; different lengths, different numbers. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Number-assignments are therefore meaningless unless they are consistent with (i)-(iii). | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A scalar quantity is one that is given by a single number, as opposed to an ordered n-tuple. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A vector quantity is one that is given by an ordered pair or, more generally, an ordered n-tuple. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Velocity is a vector quantity; an object s velocity is given an ordered pair of numbers, one corresponding to speed, the other to direction. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Mass, temperature, density, viscosity, pressure, speed, conductivity, and malleability are all scalar quantities. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Even though a piece of paper is a four-dimensional object, it is a one-dimensional object qua thing that has a length. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Two objects have the same length if they are length-congruent. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Two objects are length-congruent if (but, given that there are many ways to establish length-congruence, not only if) two conditions are met, namely: (i) When juxtaposed, each endpoint of the one is contiguous one of the endpoints of the other, and (ii) The distance between those two objects is constant---it doesn t wax and wane. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | L is longer than L* if L* is congruent with a proper segment of L. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Absent a definition of congruence, L is longer than L* and L and L* are length-identical are devoid of meaning. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Absent a definition of length-congruence, no object L can be a length-standard. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | For L to be a length-standard, it must be said what it is for L* to be length-identical with L. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Given some L-congruent object L*, L* is capable of serving as a length-standard. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | It may turn out that, if L* is assumed to be length-constant, conditions (i)-(iii) are satisfied, but that aleph same conditions are violated if L is assumed to be length-constant. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Length-congruence holds between one-dimensional objects; triangle-congruence holds between two-dimensional objects; pyramid-congruence holds between three-dimensional objects. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | For any integer n, there are (hypothetical, if not actual) n-dimensional objects and, consequently, n-dimensional congruence. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A given object is provisionally taken as a length-standard. A congruence-relation is defined. On that basis, other objects are measured. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Those measurements yield knowledge of physical laws. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Small distances can be measured using meter rods, and they can also be measured using light rays. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Large distances can be measured using light rays, but they cannot be measured using meter-rods. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Within narrow horizons, meter-rod measurements and optical measurements yield the same results. This is a contingent fact. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Suppose it turned out---as it well might have---that the numbers yielded by meter-rod measurements could not be coordinated with the numbers yielded by optical measurements. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | In that case, there would be no one magnitude that was measured in both ways, and statements to the effect that the Sun is n meters from the Earth would be meaningless. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | One can use a thermometer to measure the temperature of bath water. One cannot use a thermometer to measure the temperature of magma, let alone the temperature of a star. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | On the basis of thermometer-based measurements, one acquires knowledge of low-level physical laws (e.g. that such and such metals have such and such coefficients of expansion). | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | On the basis of this knowledge, one acquires knowledge of higher-level physical laws (e.g. that radiation-intensity varies inversely with the square of the distance from the heat-source). | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Day-to-day experience gives us approximate metrical knowledge, on the basis of which we can identify correlations on the basis of which we can obtain hitherto unobtainable metrical data. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | On the basis of this metrical data, we can identify precise laws, on the basis of which we can both add to and refine such metrical knowledge as we already have. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Two meter-rods can be laid side by side. Non-simultaneous events cannot be laid side by side. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If it is to be known how two such events compare in respect of duration, one must know of some periodic process that occurred during each event and, further, one must know how many installments of that processes occurred during each. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If m installments of that process occur during the one event and n installments occur during the other, then, if that process is indeed a perfectly regular one, the length of the one relative to the other is n/m. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | But it cannot be said, it will be objected, that a given periodic process is regular unless there is already a way of determining duration. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | And there is no way of determining duration except in relation to some periodic process. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Therefore, some periodic process must be stipulated to be perfectly regularity: it must be perfectly regular by convention. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | This position, duly generalized, is known as conventionalism. Conventionalism is false. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If duration is measured in terms of a process that is intuitively known to be erratic (e.g. somebody s heartbeat), the resulting measurements aren t consistent with one another. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Duration-measurements are consistent with one another if duration is measured in terms of a process that is intuitively known to be regular (e.g. the series of roundtrips made by a light beam between two mirrors whose distance from each other is fixed). | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Given that, relative to a given framework, an event cannot have distinct durations, it follows that conventionalism is false. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | An extensive magnitude is one such that the degree to which a given object has that magnitude exceeds the degree to any given one of its parts has that magnitude. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | An additive magnitude is one such that the degree to which a given object has that magnitude is the arithmetical sum of the extent to which each of its parts has that magnitude. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Length and mass are extensive, and within limits they are both additive. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Speed is extensive and, within limits, additive. Intelligence is intensive. So are temperature and density. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Given any framework F, the speed of light relative to F is c (?186,000 miles/second). | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A consequence---actually, the very essence of Special Relativity---is that there is no optical test by means of which one determine whether or not one is moving. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If speed were additive, these statements would be counterlogical. But speed, though extensive, is not additive. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If you are moving at a rate of 30 mph on a train that is moving in the same direction at a rate of 30 mph, your speed relative to the train station is less than 60 mph. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A corollary is that length is non-additive. A corollary of this corollary is that volume is not additive. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If a given object s length is given by an irrational number, that object s length cannot be established by measuring that object. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Nonetheless, it can be known that a given object s length is given by such a number. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | According to many (e.g. Russell, Poincar , Einstein), this entails that, in taking LS to be length-constant, we are simply adopting a convention, not registering a fact. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Since it is entirely a matter of convention whether a given object is such a standard, the laws of nature are determined by our conventions. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Thus, conventionalism is ambiguous. Sometimes it refers to metrical conventionalism, and sometimes it refers to nomic conventionalism. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Supposing arguendo that conventionalism is correct, it doesn t follow that the laws of nature are entirely a matter of convention. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Let strict conventionalism be the position that the laws of nature are entirely a matter of convention. Strict conventionalism isn t a form of conventionalism. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | If the laws of nature were convention-determined, as opposed to merely convention-based, there would be no need to take measurements to identify those laws. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | A system of measurement must yield consistent results: if, relative to a given metrical standard, a given object (at a given time, relative to a given framework) both has, and does not have, a given length n, then that standard cannot coherently be used. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | It is an empirical fact that, when objects that we intuitively regard as length-variable (e.g. eels, cylinder-shaped balloons) that are used as length-standards, the resulting measurements are inconsistent with one another. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | It is also an empirical fact that, when objects that we intuitively regard as length-constant are used as length-standards (e.g. platinum rods in temperature controlled rooms), the resulting measurements are consistent with each other to a high degree of approximation. | Measurement and Conventionalism
Kuczynski | Given that n=n, for any n, and given that use of an eel standard constitutes a rejection of this truism, whereas use of an optical standard constitutes acceptance of it, it must be said that, if eel-based measurements yield one set of physical laws and optics-based measurement yields a different set of laws, the latter are the laws that govern nature and the former are not. | Measurement and Conventionalism
