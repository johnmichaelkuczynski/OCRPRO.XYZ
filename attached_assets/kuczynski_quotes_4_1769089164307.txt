Kuczynski | Socrates, so it appears, was not on trial for speaking falsely but for being disruptive; and he very much seems to have been guilty of that charge, with the consequence that he weakened political resolve precisely when it was most needed. | Introduction to Socrates' Execution
Kuczynski | Socrates appears to have targeted those acceptances, with disastrous consequences for Athens, this being the real reason that he was executed. | Introduction to Socrates' Execution
Kuczynski | The real reason is that Socrates tried to blue pill his fellow Athenians with confusing and irrelevant sophistries; and rather than waste time and effort trying to combat those sophistries on their own terms, they executed him. | Introduction to Socrates' Execution
Kuczynski | Socrates caused Athenians to question their pre-existing moral beliefs, which undermined their patriotism at a time when Athens most needed it. | Introduction to Socrates' Execution
Kuczynski | In the context of a war, especially when the war in question is a civil war, all confusing discussions relating to politics must be assumed to be what the Soviets referred to as ‘agit-prop’---propaganda designed to confuse and agitate. | Introduction to Socrates' Execution
Kuczynski | But truths taken out of context, or made available to people who don’t know how to put them into context, can be as damaging as falsehoods and are likely to lead to confusion, which in turn is likely to lead to acceptance of falsehoods. | Introduction to Socrates' Execution
Kuczynski | During the period in question, Athens was involved in a bitter civil war. | Introduction to Socrates' Execution
Kuczynski | As a philosopher, Socrates was obviously head and shoulders above his peers, but the day-to-day functioning of a society requires that some positions be uncritically accepted; | Introduction to Socrates' Execution
Kuczynski | Obviously, truth is in general to be preferred to fiction. | Introduction to Socrates' Execution
Kuczynski | Socrates tried to red pill his fellow Athenians. They didn’t want to be red pilled. So they executed him. | Introduction to Socrates' Execution
Kuczynski | He distrusted non-rulers, thinking them little more than animals; and he also distrusted rulers, mainly because, it seems, he himself was one and therefore knew firsthand how untrustworthy they could be. | The Meaning of Plato’s Cave Allegory
Kuczynski | Plato was deeply distrustful of every stratum of society. | The Meaning of Plato’s Cave Allegory
Kuczynski | this allegory seems to be saying that members of society live propaganda-based lies. | The Meaning of Plato’s Cave Allegory
Kuczynski | his repeated use of terms like ‘prisoner’, ‘shackles’, and ‘blinded’ suggests as much. | The Meaning of Plato’s Cave Allegory
Kuczynski | it is not entirely clear that he is in fact discussing society. | The Meaning of Plato’s Cave Allegory
Kuczynski | Plato does not tell us much about the nature of those lies. | The Meaning of Plato’s Cave Allegory
Kuczynski | Plato's Theory of Forms is a demonstrably correct one. | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Plato | Plato himself mischaracterized his own theory, by assuming that properties must in some way or other 'resemble' their own instances. | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Kuczynski | the very essence of Plato's theory is that properties, being non-spatiotemporal, do not relate to their instances in the way in which spatiotemporal entities relate to other spatiotemporal entities | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Kuczynski | in Plato’s ‘ideal republic’, life is so micromanaged by the state that there is practically no such thing as private life. | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Kuczynski | To say that properties exist is simply to say that there are 'ways' things can be | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Plato | He believes that a person’s social position should be determined by his ‘nature.’ | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Plato | “You are,” Plato writes, “all of you in this community, brothers. But when god fashioned you, he added gold in the composition of those of you who are qualified to be Rulers (which is why your prestige is greatest); he put silver in the Auxiliaries, and iron and bronze in the farmers and other workers.” | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Plato | “Guardians,” writes Plato, “must mate the best of our men with the best of our women as often as possible, and the inferior men with the inferior women as seldom as possible, and bring up only the offspring of the best.” | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Plato | “Our men and women should be forbidden by law to live together in separate households,” Plato writes, “and all the women should be common to all the men; similarly, children should be held in common, and no parent should know its child, or child its parent.” | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Kuczynski | A way that something can be is simply a possibility as to how it can be, and such a possibility obviously isn’t a constituent of space-time | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Kuczynski | justice is identical with people staying in their ‘rightful place.’ (“To do one’s own business”, Plato writes, “is justice.” | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Kuczynski | social strata should be rigidly defined, it being necessary that the barriers between them be virtually impenetrable. | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Plato | marriages should be arranged. | Plato’s Theory of Forms
Kuczynski | according to this conception [of justice], nobody is entitled to any freedoms of any kind, which means that it is evil and false. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | To what extent does justice, in Plato’s view, depend upon the state lying to the citizenry? Completely. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | Plato himself clearly states that the state must constantly subject its own citizenry to propaganda (pro-state lies) if the state is to remain intact and unified | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | nothing is more important than unity and intactness of the state. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | Plato correctly states that such a rigidly hierarchical social arrangement cannot be sustained unless the masses are kept ignorant and constantly lied to. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | Is there anything worse for a state than being split and fragmented, or anything better than cohesion and unity? | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | The lies that, in Plato’s view, the state should require its citizens to accept are ones that the state must tell if it is to continue to enforce Plato’s conception of justice. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | The Republic is supposedly an attempt to answer the question ‘what is justice?’, but it’s really an attempt to design an utterly stable, hierarchy-based society, in which aristocrats are given their due and will not be ejected from power by the rabble. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | What is striking about the Republic is the degree of detail relating to class-distinctions, specifically to the designing and justifying of rules that severely limit interactions between classes: all done under the pretext of trying to design a ‘just’ society, the actual objective being to curb the dogs of revolution. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | And no one but the rulers must know what is happening, if we are to avoid dissension in our Guardian herd. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | Plato distinguishes between harmless and harmful state lies, claiming that the state has a duty to propagate the first and an equal duty to refrain from propagating the second. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | According to Plato, what our senses disclose to us is not real. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | have no private property beyond the barest essentials. Second, none of them shall possess a dwelling-house or storehouse to which all have not the right of entry. Next, their food shall be provided by the other citizens as an agreed wage for the duties they perform…' | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | All of which is totally absurd, of course. | Plato’s Republic and Political Philosophy
Kuczynski | The reason is that Plato is presenting political beliefs as epistemological beliefs. | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | Plato’s epistemological views make little sense if taken as epistemological views, but they make plenty of sense if taken as attempts to rationalize his social position. | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | Plato is not saying that the changeable and the observable are only part of the story; he is saying that they are none of the story. | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | The ‘good’--i.e. the ‘real’, as Plato puts it--is what conduces to social stability | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | Plato is deeply afraid of political change. | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | Plato was a reactionary. | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | Plato celebrated the supposed unreality of the observable, in keeping with his complete antipathy towards the social changes in question | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | Plato rightly believes social and political change to be a threat. | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | Descartes, by contrast, is anti-reactionary. | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | both Philosophers advocate particularly extreme forms of rationalism | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | the idea that bad things are ‘unreal’ is a non-starter. | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | Unlike Plato’s, they are attempts to cope with social unrest. | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | both OCD and philosophy were about retreating from the exigencies of external actual reality into the safety of internal pseudo-reality | The Political Basis of Plato’s Epistemological Views
Kuczynski | in the incoherent idea that society should be ruled by a philosopher king— incoherent, because societies are to be run by sapient doers, not sapient thinkers | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | in their attempt to make philosophy engage the world, Locke and Hume empiricized philosophy. But in empiricizing philosophy, Locke and Hume made philosophy collapse into pure skepticism | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | Plato’s system was completely a priori. | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | He was really talking about how to replace the world with a world of his own—a world that had little reality, and little justification, outside of his own thought-space. | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | he was talking, quite explicitly, about destroying the existing social structure and replacing it with one that had no real basis---other than a totally fabricated one---in reality | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | Locke and Hume were hard-core empiricists, their whole agenda as philosophers being to empiricize philosophy. | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | He wasn’t in any real way engaging the actual world. | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | in the absurd idea, put forth in his dialogue The Laws, that even the most minor violations of law should be punished by death | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | when it was implemented, led to loss of life and opportunity on an unprecedented scale | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | John Locke made a number of extremely reasonable points about law and economics that, when implemented, were enormously successful. | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | the rigidity of the society that he was proposing | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | the stereotyped—and in that respect decidedly OCD---protocols governing both education and, more generally, interactions between different people | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | Not all political philosophers are as guilty as Marx and Plato of failing to engage actual political realities. | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | Adam Smith was really an ex-philosopher who left the discipline of philosophy in order to start a new discipline. | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | Or consider Marx, another textbook case of a political philosopher. | Philosophy as Psychopathology
Kuczynski | x is worshipped → x is a fiction | Introduction to Cults and Religions
Kuczynski | x is worshipped → x is a projection | Introduction to Cults and Religions
Kuczynski | x is projected → x is supernatural | Introduction to Cults and Religions
Kuczynski | The cult-leader≠ somebody who is believed to be great The cult-leader=somebody on whom people believe they can project a great fiction | Introduction to Cults and Religions
Kuczynski | What is a religion? A sanitized, rationalized cult; a cult that has become respectable; that has been absorbed into society; that has become part of the economy; that has the same financial and legal commitments as any other institution; that has been institutionalized and bureaucratized into near-lifelessness: in a word, a near dead cult. | Introduction to Cults and Religions
Kuczynski | it isn’t cults that are degenerate religions; it is religions that are degenerate cults: degenerate precisely because they are so non-degenerate relative to all the usual rationality-based benchmarks and because, therefore, they are so lacking in the one thing—call it “spiritual vitality”, for lack of a less definite term—that sets religions apart from garden-variety institutions, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles. | Introduction to Cults and Religions
Kuczynski | The obvious answer is: A cult is a case of collective person-worship. The “collective” qualification is crucial. | Introduction to Cults and Religions
Kuczynski | If Sally worships Charles Manson and nobody else does, that is not a cult. And if 100 different individuals worship Charles Manson, and they all do so independently of each other, that too is not a cult: that is essentially 100 different love-affairs; it is not a single institution and is therefore not a cult. | Introduction to Cults and Religions
Kuczynski | “a cult is a case of collective person-worship” is extensionally correct (or at least approximately so: see below), | Defining Cults
Kuczynski | worshipping x ≠ Holding x in high regard To worship something is not merely to acknowledge that it has great power. | Defining Cults
Kuczynski | A hypothetical: I believe that Charles Manson is extremely intelligent, extremely capable, etc. This does not believe that I worship him; it doesn’t even mean that I idolize him. | Defining Cults
Kuczynski | but being worshipful of a given thing is not the same thing as making due allowances for its strengths. | Defining Cults
Kuczynski | To be sure, my being worshipful of Charles Manson would seem to entail my believing him to have some virtue or other (e.g. intelligence) to an extreme degree; but the entailment does not go in the opposite direction. | Defining Cults
Kuczynski | The situation doesn’t change if I believe that Charles Manson is superhumanly intelligent, capable, etc. | Defining Cults
Kuczynski | To worship x = To regard x as supernatural Importantly, “superhuman” is not the same as “supernatural.” | Defining Cults
Kuczynski | My believing that Charles Manson is supernaturally intelligent (or strong or what not) would seem to entail my being worshipful of him—as opposed to merely duly cognizant of his strengths. | Defining Cults
Kuczynski | “supernatural” is not the same as “extreme” or even “extremely extreme.” Somebody who can run 30 mph is extremely fast. | Defining Cults
Kuczynski | Somebody who can run 50 mph is superhumanly fast—but not supernaturally so. | Defining Cults
Kuczynski | “But suppose you hold your beliefs about the laws of nature fixed”, it might be objected, “and you believe that Max can exceed the speed of light: in that case, surely, you do believe that Max is supernaturally fast.” | Understanding Worship
Kuczynski | Worshipping x → One’s high regard for x not to answerable to data I cannot have reasons, not even bad ones, for judging someone to be supernaturally fast, or supernaturally intelligent, or supernaturally anything. | Understanding Worship
Kuczynski | But as long as my beliefs represent data-models—or even beliefs about the limits of such models--I cannot believe that anything is supernaturally anything. | Understanding Worship
Kuczynski | Relatedly, the difference between “supernatural” and “superhuman” is not one of degree. | Understanding Worship
Kuczynski | Smith believes that Charles Manson is superhumanly but not supernaturally intelligent; and Jones believes that Manson is in fact supernaturally intelligent. | Understanding Worship
Kuczynski | Jones doesn’t necessarily attribute more intelligence to Manson than Smith does. It may even be that, as both Smith and Jones know, Smith attributes more intelligence to Manson than Jones does. | Understanding Worship
Kuczynski | Smith believes that Manson is intelligent only as long as the data warrants it and only to the extent that the data warrants it: if new data shows that Manson is not intelligent, then, ratiocinative errors aside, Smith will stop believe that Manson is intelligent; | Understanding Worship
Kuczynski | Jones’ views concerning Manson’s intelligence are likely to have initially had a basis in the data; but Jones’ views as to the scope and extent of Manson’s intelligence are grossly out of proportion to what | Understanding Worship
Kuczynski | these errors—if we wish to call them that—are not of the garden-variety ratiocinative variety; they cannot be chalked up to mistakes on Jones’ part in modeling the relevant dataset; | Projection and Reality
Kuczynski | What data do we need to support our “belief”, for lack of a better word, that Spock has these characteristics. None, obviously, since he is a posit, a construct---a projection. | Projection and Reality
Kuczynski | We want something interactive—something we can participate in. So we find somebody who is Mr. Spock-like to a reasonable degree of approximation—call this person “Max.” | Projection and Reality
Kuczynski | Max is highly intelligent, and his intelligence seems to configured in a Spock-like way. | Projection and Reality
Kuczynski | if Max ceases to be Spock-like, the larpers would have a choice: either (i) larp around that fact, i.e., find a way to work these lapses into the larp, or (ii) dump Max and replace him with another Spock or, finally, (iii) drop the larp. | Projection and Reality
Kuczynski | evidence of his intelligence, or lack thereof, will be evaluated not on its own terms but with respect to Max’s ability to function as a Spock-proxy. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | there is necessarily a difference between evaluating Max’s conduct on its own terms, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, evaluating it with respect to his feasibility as a Spock-proxy. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | Projection as Unconscious LARPing (live action role playing) Question: Could we unconsciously assign the role of Spock to Max? | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | In general, can we unconsciously assign people roles? We obviously can. In other words, we can unconsciously project roles onto people. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | “unconscious projection” is a pleonasm, since a projection is nothing other than an unconscious assignment of a role or significance to something. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | When you consciously assign him this role, you do consciously know that Max is not in fact Spock, and the part of you that experiences Max as Spock is inhibited, though not extinguished. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | you really do experience Spock through Max. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | Projection=Virtualization You thus experience what is internal as external; you experience an idea as an objective reality. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | This apparition—for that is what it is—is necessarily experienced as “other worldly”, since it isn’t of the world that it inhabits. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | Suppose that you simply hallucinate Mr. Spock—hallucination being the purest form of projection. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | When Max makes a pedestrian statement, Max-Spock may thereby be making a deeply insightful statement. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | Max-Spock is saying that the sun is finally setting on the Federation. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | Max-Spock’s backstory is fantasy-based; so when Max-Spock makes a statement, we can read whatever we want into it, so long as we can find a way to make it consistent with that fantasy. | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | A hallucinated Mr. Spock—in other words, a Mr. Spock who is a case of pure projection---can walk on water, fly like a bird, and walk | The Supernatural and Fiction
Kuczynski | But if he does what appears to be walking on water, or he could even conceivably be construed as walking on water, that may suffice. | Divine and Supernatural Beings
Kuczynski | Ordinarily, if we see such a person, we interpret the visual data appropriately; we know that the visual data, taken by itself, leaves it open whether that person is walking on water or walking on a hard but water-covered surface, and we disambiguate the data in light of what we know the real world to permit. | Divine and Supernatural Beings
Kuczynski | Perceptual data is not infinitely ambiguous; so we are not likely to have visual data that could be interpreted as Max-Spock jumping over a nearby skyscraper; but we are likely to have visual data that could be interpreted as him doing something or other supernatural, be it walking on water (walking on a water-covered surface), telekinetically moving objects (opening a garage-door with a remote hidden in his pocket), or divining the future (making a vague comment about God’s wrath right before a stock-market crash). | Divine and Supernatural Beings
Kuczynski | x is supernatural→ x is projected If it’s projected, it’s supernatural, as we have just seen. And, to make a new point, if it’s supernatural, it’s projected. | Divine and Supernatural Beings
Kuczynski | “Supernatural” doesn’t just mean “not bound by natural law.” It means something stronger; it means “such that it is not even to be understood in terms of natural law.” | Divine and Supernatural Beings
Kuczynski | Let us suppose, if only for argument’s sake, that such phenomena exist. Even if such phenomena represent violations of natural law, they are nonetheless to be understood in terms of natural law: to understand such a phenomenon is to know that it is what comes about when such and such natural laws don’t do what they usually do. | Divine and Supernatural Beings
Kuczynski | To say of something that it is supernatural is to say that it is not of this world—that it is in this world but not of it. | Divine and Supernatural Beings
Kuczynski | Black holes are both in and of this world, and so are all other alleged singularities. | Divine and Supernatural Beings
Kuczynski | To say of something that it is “of another world” is to say there is some other reality that is its true home and that understanding it involves understanding its role in that world. | Divine and Supernatural Beings
Kuczynski | a supernatural being is a projected being; and a projected being is a fiction that we are seeing in something real. | Cult Leaders and Projection
Kuczynski | “Divine” is a subcategory of “supernatural.” To be sure, not all supernatural beings are divine. | Cult Leaders and Projection
Kuczynski | monsters may be supernatural—Michael Mayers (from the Halloween movies) is supernatural but not divine. | Cult Leaders and Projection
Kuczynski | the cult leader is necessarily perceived as supernatural. If somebody is merely perceived as competent or virtuous, that is not sufficient for that person’s being a cult leader. | Cult Leaders and Projection
Kuczynski | Had Mozart himself decided to create a cult, his “pitch”, so to speak, could not have been that he was so extraordinarily talented; it would have had to have been that he was supernatural in some way | Cult Leaders and Projection
Kuczynski | his followers are not so much following him as they are following the fiction of which their projections have made him the personification. | Cult Leaders and Projection
Kuczynski | any fiction that inhabits this world is other-worldly and therefore supernatural | Cult Leaders and Projection
Kuczynski | We will find that each of (i)-(v) is false but that they are distorted ways of expressing a number | Introduction
Kuczynski | (i) The meaning of a hypothesis what it says about the world lies in its observable consequences. | Introduction
Kuczynski | (ii) A true idea is one that allows us to control the world; a false one is one that doesn t. | Introduction
Kuczynski | (iv)  Truth happens to an idea.  | Introduction
Kuczynski | (v) Truth is made, not discovered. | Introduction
Kuczynski | James puts forth several different definitions of  pragmatism.  | Introduction
Kuczynski | (iii) True ideas are those that we can  assimilate , and false ones are those we cannot. | Introduction
Kuczynski | But we will start by going through each of these contentions individually, so as to avoid prejudging their logical interrelations. | Introduction
Kuczynski | This list contains some redundancies, as we will see. | Introduction
Kuczynski | (i) The meaning of a hypothesis—what it says about the world—lies in its observable consequences. | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
Kuczynski | the relationship between a hypothesis and its observable consequences is always contingent, never analytic | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
Kuczynski | (ii) A true idea is one that allows us to control the world; a false one is one that doesn’t. | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
James | Grant an idea or belief to be true," it says, "what concrete difference will its being true make in anyone's actual life? | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
Kuczynski | Instead of asserting some hypothesis H, you might as well just assert O, where O is a description of H’s observable consequences. But (i*) is false. | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
James | TRUE IDEAS ARE THOSE THAT WE CAN ASSIMILATE, VALIDATE, CORROBORATE, AND VERIFY. FALSE IDEAS ARE THOSE THAT WE CANNOT. | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
James | What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in experiential terms? | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
Kuczynski | H is not equivalent with O^ or, by parity of reasoning, with any other instance of O. | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
Kuczynski | the pragmatist does mean, presumably, is that: (ii#) For an idea to be true is for it increase our ability to control the world. | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
Kuczynski | (iii) True ideas are those we can ‘assimilate’, and false ones are those we cannot. | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
Kuczynski | If I believe that cyanide is poisonous, I am to that extent better able to control the world, including my own fate, than I am if I believe otherwise. | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
Kuczynski | There is also the fact the nature and degree of a claim’s usefulness varies from person to person and from time to time. | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
Kuczynski | true ideas do indeed tend to be more ‘assimilable’ than false ones. | Evaluation of Pragmatist Claims (i)-(v)
James | The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it. Truth HAPPENS to an idea. It BECOMES true, is MADE true by events. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | Is James right to say knives, forks, nations, economies, and armies are merely projective constructs, albeit useful ones? No because a construct won t be useful unless it tracks objective realities---unless, to be more specific, it is hewed to existing causal mechanisms. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | Given that truth is identical with usefulness and given that ideas often gain in usefulness, rather than having a fixed quantity of usefulness that is present in them ab initio, it follows that  truth  (i.e. usefulness) does indeed happen (i.e. accrue) to an idea. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | Not only is truth identical with usefulness: specific truths are nothing other than instruments whose purpose is to help organize experience. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | The categories in terms of which we experience the world---knife, army, rock, tree, and possibly even persistent object---do not represent external realities but merely embody ways of organizing what would otherwise be an amorphous mass of experience. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | what the pragmatist is saying is false. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | The  truths  (for lack of a better term) that are constructed out of these categories are themselves to be understood in instrumental, as opposed to representational, terms. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | an idea is hard to assimilate, we are unlikely to recognize it as being true. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | The pragmatist has no way of explaining this variability, since, for him, truth and assimilability are one the same, whereas the realist has no trouble explaining it, since, for him, assimilability is merely a contingent and circumstance-specific reflection of truth. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | The idea that space is non-Euclidean is not very useful to very many people, and acceptance of it was commensurately slow in coming. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | The seemingly tight connection between the true and the assimilable is therefore, at least in part, an appearance born of selection bias. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | (iii) involves selection bias. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | people tend to know nothing about medical conditions until they succumb to them; nothing about investing until they have money to invest; and nothing about parenting until they become parents. | Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Ontology
Kuczynski | the objects that it is useful to think in terms of must for that very reason be non-fictions, since a  fiction  isn t useful unless it tracks real causal mechanisms, in which case it isn t really a fiction. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | higher-order entities are causally coherent and, however  fictitious  they might otherwise be, therefore constitute undeniably real causal systems. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | Is pragmatism without value? Pragmatism has tremendous value as a description, not of truth per se, but of our knowledge of it and, more precisely, of our acquisition of that knowledge. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | The reason these  fictions  are useful, it must be stressed, is that they track actual causal mechanisms. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | Ideas acquire the property of being knowledge; i.e., they do not typically start out as knowledge, but they can become knowledge. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | a process of justification-construction. In a word: (v+) Knowledge is acquired by being constructed. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | A better position is to say that nations, people, etc. exist, albeit derivatively of other, more fundamental entities. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | Truth per se is discovered, not made. But knowledge is indeed made. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | Nations are composed of people; people are composed of organs; organs are composed of cells; cells are composed of molecules and atoms. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | not all explanatorily important causal mechanisms are represented in the categories in terms of which we instinctively think. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | Truth happens to an idea. Taken literally, this is both opaque and false. But replace  truth  with  the property of being knowledge.  | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | But see how far you get without these so-called fictions, as either a diagnostician (theoretician) or a practitioner (agent). | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | True ideas are those that we can  assimilate , and false ones are those we cannot, If taken literally, (iii) is at best a half-truth | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | scientists doesn t tell us that water doesn t exist; he tells us what water is. | Reinterpretation of Pragmatist Claims
Kuczynski | the false claim, urged by the pragmatist, that the truth is ipso facto empowering corresponds to the true one that knowledge is empowering. | Critique of Classical Epistemology
Kuczynski | Instances of knowledge are ipso facto empowering. | Critique of Classical Epistemology
Kuczynski | knowledge is assimilated truth, and beliefs become increasingly knowledge- constitutive as become increasingly grounded. | Critique of Classical Epistemology
Kuczynski | Knowledge-acquisition is about taking note of what exists and therefore doing as little as possible to change it. | Critique of Classical Epistemology
Kuczynski | given that there are highly assimilable false ideas and highly non-assimilable true ones. | Critique of Classical Epistemology
Kuczynski | But what (ii) incorrectly represents as a virtue of truth itself, (ii+) correctly represents as a virtue of our knowledge of it. | Critique of Classical Epistemology
Kuczynski | what they suggest (not what they not imply, be it noted, but merely suggest, albeit strongly) is that knowledge-acquisition is about passively taking in what is out there and therefore doing as little as possible to disrupt it. | Critique of Classical Epistemology
Kuczynski | much of physics is the fallout of attempts to create better weapons and dams and the like, and much of mathematics is constructed to validate this fallout. | Critique of Classical Epistemology

Kuczynski | Another, rather distinct possibility is that, in ‘disinterestedly’ contemplating truth, the theoretician (e.g., the philosopher, the pure mathematician) is exercising his ability to do what the practitioner is already doing, the idea being that theoretician is to the practitioner what the martial artist is to the soldier. | Conclusion: The Essence of Pragmatism

Kuczynski | the fact that many universities have low retention- and graduation-rates does not a represent a business opportunity, or opportunity of any other kind, for anyone, whether inside or outside of academia | Introduction
Kuczynski | These numbers seldom coincide, but they track each other. University’s with high retention rates have high graduation rates, and universities with low retention rates have low graduation rates. | Introduction
Kuczynski | A university’s retention rate is the percentage of students who stay after the first year | Introduction
Kuczynski | A university’s graduation rate is the percentage of students who graduate within six years of enrollment | Introduction
Kuczynski | Texas College is not a singularity; it is the rule, not the exception. Universities would as a rule lose far more customers than they would gain were they to change their courses of such in such a way as to make them financially more worth doing. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | Universities pay people for degrees. That is what universities sell, and that is what people pay them for; and with relatively minor qualifications, that is all that people pay them for. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | if Max does get a degree---even if while getting it he learns nothing and indeed becomes less intelligent---it will make it possible for him to ply his trade and will open up an entire world of additional professional possibilities. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | From a financial perspective, a university has relatively cogent reasons to want a high retention rate: when a student doesn t enroll for a second year, that university loses business, and it doesn t when he does. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | A university has less strong reasons to want a high graduation rate. If a student comes back year after year and never graduates, the university makes more money than it does if he graduates. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | If a university made the systemic changes to itself necessary to improve retention rates, it would lose most of its existing customer-base. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | Colleges Sell Degrees, not Instruction | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | rates are necessarily at least as high as graduation rates and in practice are always higher. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | universities with low graduation and retention rates almost always tend to stay in business. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | OMC s sell products and services. That is what people pay them for. That is all they pay them for. That is not what people pay universities for. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | each of these colleges does give out degrees and each is financially doing extremely well. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | even if a university has a graduation-rate of 0%, as is the case with a number of institutions, it doesn t follow that nobody graduates from it, only that nobody does so within six years of enrollment. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | Great Basin College in Nevada has a retention rate of 4% and a graduation rate of 0%, but it is not in financial trouble. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | What would happen to Great Basin College in Nevada if it ceased to give out degrees? Or to Dalton State? Or to Oglala Lakota College? Their enrollments would instantly drop to zero. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | Would universities with low retention rates like to have higher retention rates? Of course. Do they need to have higher retention rates? Evidently not. | Retention and Graduation Rates
Kuczynski | People with degrees have options, and people without degrees don t. | Universities vs. Open-market Companies
Kuczynski | Colleges sell those degrees. That is what they do. Colleges also provide instruction. | Universities vs. Open-market Companies
Kuczynski | Students don t want particularly high-quality instruction: high-quality instruction is demanding, and since they are paying for degrees, they want to have to jump through as few hoops as possible to get those degrees. | Universities vs. Open-market Companies
Kuczynski | If colleges improved instruction if they made it more demanding and if they those who received them more economically competitive---they would indeed attract more of a certain kind of student: they would attract more savants and truth-seekers, as well as aspiring doctors and engineers. | Universities vs. Open-market Companies
Kuczynski | If enough people enroll, then the university is financially ok. | Universities vs. Open-market Companies
Kuczynski | It is assumed that retention-rates must stay above a certain level for a university to be financially stable. If that is true, the rate in question is extremely low. | Universities vs. Open-market Companies
Kuczynski | Universities with extremely low retention rates tend to have extremely high acceptance rates; and they also tend to have moderately high enrollment rates, since the students they accept have limited options. | Universities vs. Open-market Companies
Kuczynski | A successful angel investor may invest a small amount in 100 companies, knowing that 99 of will fail and also knowing that the one that succeeds will make up for the others. | Universities vs. Open-market Companies
Kuczynski | Even if it wants a higher retention, it doesn t necessarily need it. | Universities vs. Open-market Companies
Kuczynski | Third, there may not be anything it can do to increase its retention rates that wouldn t alienate most of its customer base. | Universities vs. Open-market Companies
Kuczynski | But universities sell degrees nothing else. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | If they even try to make themselves more than just good enough to preserve the prestige-level of their degrees, they will alienate enough of their customer-base to appreciably worsen their financial situation. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | If they turn themselves into genuinely efficiently educational entities, they will alienate most of their present and future customers. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | The instruction has to be just good enough, in certain respects in certain subjects at certain junctures, for there to be a perception on the part of enough people that it is worth having a degree from that institution. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | Consequently, the ideal situation for a university is when its degrees have prestige and as few people as possible are actually giving them that prestige. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | For so long as that degree has prestige, the way to maximize enrollment is to have as few students giving it prestige and as many as possible merely benefiting from that prestige. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | Most college graduates tend to have well-paid jobs with poorly defined functions. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | They end up, to be blunt, being pencil pushers within corporations or government-agencies, and are extremely well-paid for doing little more than showing up and not making waves. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | A corollary is that most of a university s business depends on its providing instruction that is on average lackluster. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | A degree from Harvard doesn t have to be backed by good instruction. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | Most of X s students want the prestige of a degree from X without having to go through four years of intellectual bootcamp. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | The changes just described would certainly benefit people who did end up attending X, and it might well make those people more employable than the X students who preceded them. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | But would those changes benefit X? No. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | Instruction would certainly improve, and that might well bring in more of a certain kind of student. | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | How Useful Do Students Really Want Their Educations To Be? | The Role of Degrees
Kuczynski | In recent years a new discipline has emerged called Knowledge Management (KM); and for reasons that will become clear, KM is believed to have the potential to help institutions become more efficient. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | Contrariwise, if colleges got rid of easy majors and insisted on producing only useful undergraduates, they would alienate those students. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | In any case, although majoring in a non-practical subject at a low-tier (or even a high-tier) school may not immediately have a good outcome, it is often a risk that it is rational to take. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | But when people drop out, it is usually for good reasons, and it isn t a tragedy for anyone. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | When people drop out, it is usually because they believe that they stand to lose more by staying in school than by dropping out, and in most cases they are right. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | In the United States in 2019, most jobs are useless. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | And until it does happen, it is not irrational for people to do easy majors and bide their time after college until they land a well-paid sinecure. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | When in Doubt, Drop Out: Dispelling the Myth that Only Losers Drop Out | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | When people drop out from such institutions, it may be to pounce on a job-opportunity that won t last and is better than what will be available to them when they graduate. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | KM cannot help when poor internal communications are not the issue or, of course, when there simply is no issue. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | They are useless because they can be useless, because the small part of the population that is productive is so productive that the rest doesn t have to be. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | So yes, if the percentage of the population that was actually useful dropped too close to zero, then the economy would fall apart. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | If they finish out their degrees in religious studies or political science from VCU or Sul Rock State, they may become probation officers, Community College Administrators, or mid-level managers at a local firm. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | 100% employment, because everybody had to be employed, and everybody had to be employed because production was so inefficient. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | In Britain in 1820, there very few useless jobs, but the jobs that people had tended to be difficult and unpleasant. | Knowledge Management in Universities
Kuczynski | Finally, and most significantly, if one wants to improve education and to make money doing so, there is at the current an enormous opportunity. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | Universities would alienate their customers as well as most of their own employees if they did change, especially if those changes involved making them better at teaching their students and at making them employable. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | Knowledge-management Cannot be of Assistance to Universities Unlike OMC s, universities actually depend on poor internal communications. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | Universities are extremely reluctant to change. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | Universities don t have to change. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | When an organization is in the business of providing results, objectives are well-defined, with correspondingly positive consequences for knowledge-management within that organization. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | University departments are highly isolated from and fiercely independent of one another. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | OMC s are about providing optimal products and services, whereas universities are about maintaining prestige. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | In general, KM problems are hard to fix but easy to avoid, and they are avoided by designing companies properly. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | Knowledge-management is possible when the organization in question has definite objectives, and when it does not have definite objectives, knowledge-management is as difficult as those objectives are vague. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | Consequently, were departments not mutually isolated and were they in the habit of cooperating with one another whenever students stood to benefit, they would have to step up their game considerably to survive the consequent scrutiny. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | The fact that many universities have lower retention- and graduation-rates than they would like does not represent much of a business opportunity for anyone. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | Universities are doing well financially and otherwise, despite low retention- and graduation-rates. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | If a company's objective is to  improve wellness' or  broaden minds,' then it tends not to be clear whether a given piece of information is worth relaying. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | Some students do like this kind of professor; most do not. | Proposed Online University Model (DMO)
Kuczynski | The most important fact about DMO is that students pay for results, not services. | DMO Structure and Principles
Kuczynski | In general, whereas results-markets are inherently efficient, service-markets are inherently inefficient. | DMO Structure and Principles
Kuczynski | DMO does not sell prestige; it sells competence. | DMO Structure and Principles
Kuczynski | Inefficiency and poor internal communications are lucrative when the client is paying for services, and they are expensive only when he is paying for results. | DMO Structure and Principles
Kuczynski | When services are sold, there is no money in results, and services have to be inflated. | DMO Structure and Principles
Kuczynski | A Corollary: Education Must be Digitized Whenever Possible | DMO Structure and Principles

Kuczynski | How DMO Turns Non-STEM Students into STEM Students | DMO Structure and Principles
Kuczynski | the money flows up. Instructors are directly sought by students based on their performance-statistics | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | DMO always offers students the ability to  test out.  | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | a student can get a given accreditation just by passing the examination in question: no time need be spent  in class.  | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | Instructor-pay is therefore based on volume of work and satisfaction of such benchmarks. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | Instructor-revenue is determined entirely by instructor-competence. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | students can earn credible degrees from DMO in a fraction of the time, and with a fraction of the expense, that would be involved in getting a degree from another institution. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | Payments to Go Straight from Student to Instructor | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | There is no permanent employment at DMO, let alone tenure, only contract-work. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | Disciplines that have no practical value should either be jettisoned or modified so to have practical value. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | a one year-degree would have meaning. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | instructors tend to function as gatekeepers: they are not there to instruct, but rather to open the gates, as they see fit. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | There is no tenure. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | universities are expensive and slow. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | a wider variety of disciplines and of degrees than in current institutions of higher learning. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | publications are irrelevant to hiring decision, and so are letters of reference. | Implementation of DMO
Kuczynski | The essence of DMO is that it is results-based, not service-based. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | In the present work, we put forth a detailed plan for a university (DMO) that will do what existing universities are failing to do, and nothing is preventing anybody from implementing that plan. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | There is little hope of reforming unviersities. They don t want to be reformed, and they don t stand to gain by being reformed. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | Thanks to the resulting high-quality of instruction, DMO need not deny service to anyone, since its reputation is based on how much it improves its students, not on how smart they are to begin with. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | The instructors will have no choice but to charge exactly what their services are worth; and because the instructors pay the management, and not the other way around, the management will be forced to hire and retain the best instructors | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | Theoretically, universities are supposed to instruct; but they don t instruct, so much as they wall out people who need instruction, choosing to open the gates only to people who can self-teach their way through their majors. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | DMO-instructors are instructors, not gatekeepers. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | Once in existence, DMO will be the very embodiment of optimal knowledge-management. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | Universities don t want to be better, and they are right not to want to be better, since their business would dry up if they were better. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | Consequently, instructor-earnings depend only the quality and volume of their work. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | If universities made the kinds of systemic changes to themselves needed to guarantee higher retention rates, they would alienate most of their current customers. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | who could be creditable practitioners of the corresponding fields end up being exiled into useless, soft majors. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | Also, universities don t need higher retention rates. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | Though prima facie reasonable, this suggestion is quite misconceived. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | It has been suggested that universities might improve their retention-rates through judicious use of knowledge-management. | Challenges and Opportunities
Kuczynski | universities provide far less instruction than people assume. Capable students tend to teach themselves. | Conclusion
Kuczynski | But if a law-school graduate lands what would be considered a low-end lawyer-job...he will make far more money and have far more job-security than the vast majority of the population. | Conclusion

Kuczynski | the revenue from such services is less than one tenth of one percent of the revenue from students who are enrolled in degree programs. | Conclusion
Kuczynski | universities don’t want to right-size themselves by downsizing. | Conclusion
Kuczynski | Are these lawyers useful? No. Not in general. In fact, they tend to be negatively useful. | Conclusion
Kuczynski | Dog the Bounty Hunter is financially successful despite not having a college degree. | Conclusion
Kuczynski | Yes, enormously, without any doubt. At first, people are happy to get that upfront pay. But once they get used to it and no longer feel the stick of urgency, they need the carrot of bonuses keep on plugging away, especially if the work involves creativity or insight. | Productivity and Motivation
Kuczynski | If you are dealing with low level workers boozers who are putting rocks in a bag then not so much, since they are more interested in how little they can do and get by than they are in moving forward. | Productivity and Motivation
Kuczynski | But with talent gotta reward it. How do you prove that any consistent set of sentences can be extended to a maximal consistent set? | Productivity and Motivation
Kuczynski | You think bad thoughts about Allah because you want to be free and | Productivity and Motivation
Kuczynski | What we refer to as  mathematical talent  is about being able to operationalize mathematical intelligence outside of those contexts in which it is automatically operational. | Logical and Mathematical Concepts
Kuczynski | And the fascination that all people have for mathematics is the fascination that all people have for externalizations of hidden aspects of themselves themselves. | Logical and Mathematical Concepts
Kuczynski | Explanation of (1): Suppose for argument s sake that there are minimal units of physical composition, these being maximally simple building blocks of nature. Given only that these entities are physically simple (or at least relatively so), it doesn t follow that the truths that describe them, and in terms of which we are to understand them, are correspondingly simple. | Logical and Mathematical Concepts
Kuczynski | Consequently, there are, in this sense, no  atoms  of nature -no non-composite truths out of which other truths can be constructed or from which they can be derived. | Logical and Mathematical Concepts
Kuczynski | If by  mature , you mean forfeit their own welfare for the petty whims of their  significant  other, then, sadly, the answer is sometimes  yes.  | Logical and Mathematical Concepts
Kuczynski | Descartes once said, "Now as far as ideas are concerned, provided they are considered solely in themselves and I do not refer them to anything else, they cannot strictly speaking be false." | Client Relationships and Business Advice
Kuczynski | In fact, dissociation diminishes the likelihood of such distortions, since it disarms those representations by robbing them of emotional force and therefore makes it unnecessary to disarm them by altering them. | Client Relationships and Business Advice
Kuczynski | The most dangerous question in philosophy is whether there can be political solutions to biologically or culturally rooted problems. | Client Relationships and Business Advice
Kuczynski | People on the left hold that extensions of government will solve the problem, which they sometimes do but sometimes don’t. | Client Relationships and Business Advice
Kuczynski | What is striking, however, is that there is practically no system of government that has not worked at certain junctures and that also hasn’t failed at others, calling into question the whole legitimacy of the discipline of political philosophy and, indeed, of the very concept of the "proposition" state. | Client Relationships and Business Advice
Kuczynski | There is only so far political systems can go in the way of contravening biological facts (e.g. differences between genders) without imperiling their own viability, and the most dangerous question of contemporary philosophy is what those limits are. | Client Relationships and Business Advice
Kuczynski | But a lot of good work, by people of all ideological stripes and backgrounds, has been done on it. | Client Relationships and Business Advice
Kuczynski | Eugene Mills’ solution to Zeno’s paradox For any possible universe U, there is some distance D such that nothing in U can move at all without covering a distance of at least D. | Client Relationships and Business Advice
Kuczynski | If you are obliterated and some person who is exactly like you appears a moment later right next to where you were standing, that person isn t you. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | In a Mills-universe, nothing has a past and, therefore, nothing has a future. Everything that exists, exists for an instant and then vanishes. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | Therefore, a Mills-universe is a non-universe. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | Relative spatial and temporal position are to be understood in causal terms. Events are simultaneous if neither can affect the other; otherwise non-simultaneous. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | Bertrand Russell s solution to Zeno s paradox The sum of infinitely many positive numbers may be finite (e.g. 1+ + +  =2), and any finite number can be represented as such a sum. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | Zeno is asking how a given object can take that first step. He is asking how an object that moves 2 inches can move inch, and then another   inch, and then another   inch, and so on. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | Once an object moves that first inch, all of the remaining inches are a foregone conclusion. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | All position is relative position. Therefore, changes in position are changes in relative position. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | For there is nothing in relation to which x s position can change. Nor can it be said that x exists at a given time or for a certain period of time. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | So when it is said that xi must move   inch in order to move an inch, and   inch in order to move a   inch, and so on, the point being made is this: (1) Given any displacement d, no matter how small, if the universe were better populated and otherwise more heterogeneous than it currently is but all other factors, in including the laws of nature, were held constant, it would be possible for there to be an even more smaller displacement d*. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | The more objects there are in a given universe, the greater the number of distances with which a given distance can be compared. The more such distances, the higher degree of precision with which a given distance can be meaningfully described. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | Therefore, to say that motion is continuous is to make the correct, if trivial, point that the class of changes capable of being undergone by a universe whose sole occupants are x1 xn is, for any number m, a proper subset of the class of changes capable of being undergone by an otherwise identical universe whose occupants are x1 xn xn+m. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions
Kuczynski | The sole occupant of a universe is that universe. Contrariwise, a space-time manifold has no existence independently of its occupants. | Philosophical and Ethical Questions

Kuczynski | jobs are being automated. job-seekers are on the defensive. i don t know that it s better anywhere else, but the trend is clear: more and more automation, fewer and fewer jobs. increasing shift towards entrepreneurship and ai-related positions. | Education and Career Insights
Kuczynski | Yes. Nobody reads them. Ever. Unless they re looking for a lead-in for their own never-to-be-read (because not worthy of being read) recycle-job. Go ahead and read some recent  work  on the mind-body problem, or (God forbid) on  ethics , and you will truly understand the concept of nothingness. | Education and Career Insights
Kuczynski | And nobody reads them because they re boring, and they re boring because they re bad, because academia, with some minor qualifications (that don t apply to you have if you have to ask) is not where the action is now. Those papers are for show only. They look nice as in the covers and typography and lay-out all look nice. But there s not very much there. | Education and Career Insights
Kuczynski | Setting aside medical journals and few other journals of that ilk, they literally cannot give away copies of the most  prestigious  journals. They cannot even give away e-copies. They get spam complaints. Mind, Philosophical Review, the Journal of Philosophy -it turns out that, when readership-levels are independently assessed, their readerships are quite literally non-existent. | Education and Career Insights
Kuczynski | And they re non existent because those journals are not journals; they re nice little hunks of processed wood, which have about as much meaning as that mug of yours that says  World s Best Dad.  | Education and Career Insights
Kuczynski | 100 years ago, academic journals served a function. Crelle s Journal, the Monatshrifte in which Einstein and Godel published their results yes, these were nice sources of information. But academic journals now are about circling the wagons and bestowing in-house titles on other members of a dying and now totally irrelevant club. | Education and Career Insights
Kuczynski | The obvious response to all this is that academic journals are not for general consumption. This seems reasonable enough but when I say nobody reads them, I mean nobody. Real thinkers don t go there for ideas; they flee from the journals, as from wild bees. | Education and Career Insights
Kuczynski | If anyone thinks otherwise, I invite them to show me peer-reviewed publication list, and I will then show them mine. I stopped publishing in the journals, and even stopped publishing with academic publishers, because that is no longer how ideas are disseminated. They are at this point purely token, and they don t engage anything. | Education and Career Insights
Kuczynski | These papers are just markers in slimy bureaucracy-internal games; and because people think otherwise, the pathetically slow distribution mechanisms to which they belong get to keep on jamming up thought. | Education and Career Insights
Kuczynski | Finally, there is old saw that these various papers are like atoms jostling against one another what a given one does tends to be negligible, but, so it is alleged, they collectively constitute a rich discourse out of which great things sometimes come. Totally false. Nothing is innovated in the journal-space. Nothing gets published if it has so much as a shred of merit. | Education and Career Insights

Kuczynski | In some ways, the economy is reverting to what it was like two hundred years ago, when it was less about  jobs  and more about trades. | Social and Psychological Observations
Kuczynski | What arguments will never be resolved? | Social and Psychological Observations
Kuczynski | There are two classes of such disputes: (i) Those that are emotional in nature, though they are presented as being about objective moral verities. | Social and Psychological Observations
Kuczynski | Disagreements between men and women (e.g. as a husband, is Jim morally obligated to his wife to be both a bread-winner and 100% monogamous?) | Social and Psychological Observations
Kuczynski | Disagreements between the left wing and the right wing (e.g. is affirmative action legitimate?) | Social and Psychological Observations
Kuczynski | One must necessarily be a Platonist. There is no way to replace references to numbers, mathematical operations, or other mathematical structures with references to spatiotemporal entities. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | there no observable instances of infinite quantities. One can see two hands, three apples, and so on, but not infinitely many. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | You can put one rock on top of another, but that is not the operation of arithmetical addition. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | one can observe analogues of negation—one can witness acts of destruction, for example— but not negation per se, since the latter, unlike the former, takes truths and falsehoods for its operands. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | As for the idea that infinite quantities and arithmetical operations and other distinctively mathematical structures can be 'abstracted' from observable phenomena—that is irrelevant, since it speaks only to our knowledge of those operations, not to their existence and therefore doesn’t eliminate the corresponding need for a Platonic metaphysics. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | abstraction is the process not of creating, but of recognizing the existence of the abstract entity in question and therefore presupposes said entity’s existence. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | there is no way to eliminate the need for non-spatiotemporal entities. There is no way to translate the statement 'one can have most of the properties of a good general without being a general' into a statement that doesn’t presuppose the existence of properties per se; nor indeed is there any way to validate even so rudimentary an inference as 'John and Tom are both smart; therefore, there is something that they have in common', since 'something' in this context means 'some property.' | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | Right now the most urgent and therefore interesting philosophical problem is how information can be encrypted to as to expedite the transmission of it and maximize the absorption of it. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | Commerce is now quite as much about the exchange of information as it is about the exchange of physical goods and services. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | whereas power used to be about ownership of land and other physical assets, power is not about ownership of ideas. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | the problem is not always that one lacks information; sometimes it is that one has too much of it or doesn’t have it in forms in which it is easily communicated or easily absorbed. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | right now, the name of the game is to figure out knowledge can so encrypted as to be maximally bioavailable and maximally easy (for both living and artificial systems) to store and transmit. | Technology and Future Trends
Kuczynski | Absolutely not. He was the opposite. He was not psychopathic enough, frankly. He was a very decent fellow with a kind heart, who caught a glimpse of the darker side of life and was not able to process it. | Philosophical Figures and Theories
Kuczynski | Logic studies rules of inference. Mathematics studies general properties of structures. (Mathematics studies numbers because they encode structural information.) | Philosophical Figures and Theories
Kuczynski | High IQ university graduates strongly tend to out-earn IQ-comparable non-graduates. Low IQ vocationally trained non-graduates strongly tend to out-earn IQ-comparable college graduates and non-graduates without vocational training. Medium-IQ graduates marginally tend to out-earn IQ-comparable vocationally trained non-graduates, with the qualification that that medium—IQ vocationally trained non-graduates have dramatically higher levels of fulfillment. Non-vocationally trained non-graduates are at the bottom of the hierarchy. | Philosophical Figures and Theories
Kuczynski | College is a sham, and within a few years, judicious use of already existing digital resources will see to it that it is a distant memory. | Philosophical Figures and Theories
Kuczynski | Godel is perhaps best-known for his first incompleteness theorem. An incompleteness theorem is one to the effect that there is no recursive definition of a given statement-class. | Philosophical Figures and Theories
Kuczynski | Nothing, since contradictions between facts and logic means that the wrong logic is being used. If you’re asking “what is counterintuitive?”, that’s a different matter. | Philosophical Figures and Theories
Kuczynski | It yields insight but not knowledge. | Philosophical Figures and Theories
Kuczynski | An incompleteness theorem is one to the effect that there is no recursive definition of a given statement-class. The first such theorem was that there is no recursive definition of the class of truths of the form “x is a real number.” This was proved by George Cantor in the 1870’s, and the proof involved a technique known as “diagonalization.” | Philosophical Figures and Theories
Kuczynski | Taking one pill makes you twice as good. Therefore, taking 10 pills makes you feel 10 times better. | Philosophical Figures and Theories

Kuczynski | Identity is about continuity. If parts have to go to ensure the requisite degree of continuity, then so be it. | Logic and Reasoning
Kuczynski | Absolutely not. A psychopath-free society would be a society of eunuchs. | Logic and Reasoning
Kuczynski | The theme of  Sexy Beast  is:  you re soft; reality is hard. Get off your rear end and make it happen.  | Logic and Reasoning
Kuczynski | Wittgenstein s so-called  Rule Following Paradox  doesn t exist. The paradox is that in narrowly defined contexts the behaviors involved in following distinct rules are indistinguishable. | Logic and Reasoning
Kuczynski | Wittgenstein holds this because he has an absurdly constricted conception of what counts as a mental state, believing that the mental comprises little behind a few itches and tickles and other sensations. | Logic and Reasoning
Kuczynski | A conditional statement is one of the form  if p, then q , e.g.  if JM has three cars, then JM has an odd number of cars.  Second, the  antecedent  of a conditional statement is the  if  part, and the  consequent  is the  then  part. | Logic and Reasoning
Kuczynski | All that matters is the relationship between antecedent and consequent. The truth-values of antecedent and consequent are irrelevant, with the qualification that, if the conditional is true, then the consequent cannot be false if the antecedent is true. | Logic and Reasoning
Kuczynski | You cannot change your sexuality. What you can do is accept it and, on that basis, alter how you channel it. But you like what you like, and that s the end of it. | Miscellaneous Questions and Answers
Kuczynski | Any given body of truths is necessarily internally consistent. Therefore mathematics, setting aside the odd screw-up, is consistent. | Miscellaneous Questions and Answers
Kuczynski | People make the mistake of assuming that  consistent  means  capable of being axiomatized.  Being able to axiomatize a given body of truths is sufficient but not necessary for establishing its consistency. | Miscellaneous Questions and Answers
Kuczynski | Consistency is either established in a local, block-chain fashion, by comparing statements with other statements in their immediate dialectical vicinity, or by establishing truth. | Miscellaneous Questions and Answers
Kuczynski | The truth is that, in mathematics as in other domains, consistency is a consequence of truth, not vice versa. | Miscellaneous Questions and Answers
Kuczynski | The differences are far more important than the similarities. Camus held that, since the morality of his parents was now losing its hold, morality was categorically an illusion, and he believed this to entail that life categorically has no meaning. | Miscellaneous Questions and Answers
Kuczynski | Nietzsche obviously did believe that a lot of the moral codes people accept are basically so much soul-destroying propaganda; and he also believed that, during his lifetime, their lack of legitimacy was quickly becoming apparent. | Miscellaneous Questions and Answers
Kuczynski | Camus was a Paul Ryan figure who believed that the good life is the convention-based life, whereas Nietzsche believed convention to separate us from our true selves and, therefore, from the good life. | Miscellaneous Questions and Answers
Kuczynski | Sartre, hands down. Sartre s message is: | You are free; deal with it; make the mot of it. Life is a roller-coaster; don t water down the experience with false attachments.  Which is a good message. | Miscellaneous Questions and Answers
Kuczynski | Camus  boring little diatribes about how it is meaningless are meaningless. He says the Sisyphus is happy because he has to roll that rock up that hill over and over again, the idea being that life is so meaningless that we need repetition and circularity to give it meaning. | Miscellaneous Questions and Answers

Kuczynski | Universal grammar cannot be algorithmically characterized. | Summary and Extensions
Kuczynski | Programming language theory: Cannot enumerate all possible programming languages. | Summary and Extensions
Kuczynski | Formal semantics: No master theory of meaning. Any recursive semantic theory will miss possible languages. | Summary and Extensions

Kuczynski | Proof can't self-certifyThis Theorem: Formality needs something beyond formality (meta-formal judgment). | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | The pattern: * Gödel showed that formal systems need something outside themselves (semantic truth) * This theorem shows that formalism itself needs something outside itself (meta-formal judgment) * At each level, closure is impossible | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | If rationality cannot be exhaustively formalized, what is rationality? If formalism requires non-formal resources, what are those resources? | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | Natural languages are not a single recursive expression-class. They are hierarchies of such classes, stratified by self-reference levels. | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | English = E₀ ∪ E₁ ∪ E₂ ∪ ... ∪ Eₙ ∪ ... Where: E₀ = Base recursive expression-class (doesn't mention 'English' or reference the language itself) | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | This is Tarski's hierarchy for truth, but applied to language-as-object rather than just truth predicates. | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | An expression truly belongs to a language L only if: 1. It's syntactically well-formed in L (built from L-vocabulary using L-rules) AND 2. It has semantic content in L (refers, has truth-conditions, means something) | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | The hierarchy isn't just adding new vocabulary. It's semantically activating syntax that was already present but inert. | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | Generative Eₙ₊₁ from Eₙ requires: * Semantic judgment (which strings get semantically activated?) * Metalinguistic creativity (introducing new referring terms) * Recognition of what constitutes 'talking about Eₙ as a totality' | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | The series (E₀, E₁, E₂, ...) is not recursive. This is a direct application of the main theorem: recursivity cannot recursively enumerate itself. | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | The Fundamental Point Even if we grant that (E₀, E₁, E₂, ...) is recursive, the language in which we describe that recursivity cannot itself be part of the series. | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | Why Logicism Failed The logicist project (Frege, Russell) aimed to reduce all mathematics to logic. But they never had a clear conception of what 'logic' meant. | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | Logic = Whatever System I'm Using (second-order logic with comprehension) * Problem: This is set theory in disguise, not logic | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | This theorem shows: They couldn't even recursively enumerate the candidate formal systems, so even the restricted project can't be carried out algorithmically. | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | No language can fully characterize itself * Parallel to: No formal system can fully characterize formal systems * Parallel to: Recursivity cannot recursively define itself | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | Semantic grounding requires stepping outside * To give meaning to self-referential expressions, you need a metalevel * The metalevel itself requires a meta-metalevel * No final level of complete semantic closure | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | The limits of language cannot be stated in language * Wittgenstein's ladder, but mathematically proven * Any statement of language's limits requires transcending those limits | Natural Language and Metalinguistic Hierarchies
Kuczynski | Conclusion We've shown that natural languages cannot be single recursive expression-classes. They must be hierarchies where: 1. Each level can refer to lower levels but not to itself 2. Syntax can be recursive at each level, but semantics requires non-recursive operations 3. The generating series itself is not recursive 4. Any attempt to characterize the hierarchy requires stepping outside it | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | The pattern is clear: Formalism cannot formalize its own boundaries. Recursion cannot enumerate itself. Language cannot linguistically characterize itself. | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | And as we'll see in Part IV, this pattern has infected multiple domains through the false equation Rational = Recursive, creating pseudo-problems that dissolve once we recognize non-recursive rationality. | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | The central claim: a false equation has infected philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science, and AI for over a century: RATIONAL = RECURSIVE | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | This equation says: to make sense of something is to recursively formalize it. To understand X is to give recursive rules for X. Reasoning is following algorithms. Knowledge is what can be recursively justified. | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | Semantics is not recursive. This is the fundamental architecture of natural language. | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | But meaning is not always compositional. You can use recursive syntax to build expressions whose semantics is non-recursive. | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | Semantically: * ✗ Has no referent in E₀ (E₀ doesn't exist as a completed object yet) * Only acquires meaning in E₁ (when E₀ becomes an object) * ✗ Meaning is not a compositional function of part-meanings * ✗ Non-recursive | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | Standard semantic compositionality principle: ⟦α β⟧ = f(⟦α⟧, ⟦β⟧) The meaning of a complex expression is a function of: * The meanings of its parts * How they're syntactically combined | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | But "the totality of expressions of English" violates this: * Each word has meaning in E₀ * Syntactic combination is well-formed * ✗ But the whole phrase has no referent in E₀ | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | This is not a bug. It's a feature of how natural language handles self-reference and metalinguistic expressions. | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | Why Compositionality Fails The General Principle For any natural language L with syntax S: You can use S to construct expressions whose: * Syntax is recursive (built by S's rules) * Semantics is non-recursive (meaning/reference not compositionally determined) | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | Formal semantics (Montague, Davidson, etc.) tries to give recursive semantic rules: * ⟦John runs⟧ = runs(john) * ⟦every man runs⟧ = ∀x[man(x) → runs(x)] This works for fragments of language where: * All primitives have fixed referents * Compositionality holds * No metalinguistic expressions * No naming/ostension * No self-reference | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | These are semantically essential but non-recursive. Linguistic Competence: UG + X Vindicating and Extending Chomsky Chomsky discovered that language has a recursive core: Universal Grammar (UG). But UG is not the whole story. | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | The naming/ostension capacity is irreducibly non-recursive because: Depends on demonstrative reference: * "That child there" requires perceptual grounding * Perception is not a linguistic/recursive operation | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | The Empirical Observation The meta-semantic capacity is empirically obvious: Every time someone: * Names their newborn child * Coins a new term for a discovered phenomenon * Creates a neologism for a new concept * Points and says "that thing there" | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | So: Neural networks not being recursive is a feature, not a bug. They might actually be better suited to approximate the non-recursive aspects of language than rule-based systems ever were. | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion
Kuczynski | Neural/Statistical Approaches Are Vindicated: * Not inferior to symbolic/recursive approaches * Actually better suited for non-recursive aspects of language * The future of CL, not a temporary expedient | Breaking the Stranglehold of Recursion

Kuczynski | The false equation Rational = Recursive has infected multiple domains | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | There is no recursive/algorithmic method for going from observational data to scientific theories. | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | Therefore, scientific discovery is irrational. There is no "logic of discovery," only a "logic of justification." | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | But the implicit premise—that rationality = recursivity—is wrong. | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | Scientific discovery is rational, just not recursive. | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | No algorithm goes from "elliptical orbits" to inverse-square law | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | No mechanical procedure generates the theory | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | It's warranted by the evidence (observations support the theory) | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | Recognizing deep structural similarity | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | Once we reject that equation: Discovery is non-recursive ✓ Discovery is rational ✓ No problem ✓ | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | There IS a "logic of discovery"—just not a recursive logic. | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality
Kuczynski | Scientific discovery is: Non-recursive ✓ Rational ✓ Exemplary of human cognitive capacity ✓ | Scientific Discovery and Non-Recursive Rationality

Kuczynski | Neural networks being non-recursive is favorable (allows approximation of non-recursive rational capacities) | Neural Networks Vindicated
Kuczynski | Recursive created pseudo-problems: * Hume's problem: Induction seems irrational (because it's not deductive) * Popper's irrationalism: Scientific discovery can't be rational (no algorithm for it) * Wittgenstein's paradox: Rule-following leads to infinite regress * GOFAI's failure: Intelligence can't be achieved without symbolic rules * Foundationalist anxiety: Knowledge requires impossible recursive justification | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | RATIONALITY = The skilled capacity to recognize truth-relevant patterns in situations and respond appropriately to them. | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Truth-relevant patterns include: Evidential patterns: What supports what Explanatory patterns: What accounts for what Coherence patterns: What fits together Predictive patterns: What follows from what Structural patterns: Underlying similarities across surface differences Anomaly patterns: What doesn't fit, what's surprising Causal patterns: What produces what effects | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Rationality as Skill, Not Rule-Following Compare rationality to: Carpentry: * Skilled carpenters don't follow explicit rules * They SEE what the situation requires * Respond appropriately to wood grain, load-bearing, aesthetics * Systematic (not random) but non-algorithmic | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Chess mastery: * Masters don't calculate move-trees algorithmically * They SEE threats, opportunities, positional patterns * Respond with moves that fit the pattern * Trainable through practice, but not rule-based | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Medical diagnosis: * Expert diagnosticians don't apply decision trees mechanically * They RECOGNIZE disease patterns * See which symptoms cluster together * Developed through case experience, not rule memorization | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Even using deductive rules requires pattern recognition: To apply modus ponens ("If P then Q; P; therefore Q"): * You must recognize that your situation matches this pattern * You must see that you have P and (P→Q) * You must perceive that Q follows | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Newton's Discovery of Universal Gravitation What happened: * Observed: Planetary orbits, moon's motion, falling objects, tides, comets * Recognized: These mechanisms share a structural pattern * Saw: Inverse-square force law unifies all phenomena | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | The discovery WAS the pattern recognition: * Seeing how disparate observations fit together * Recognizing the mathematical structure underlying diverse phenomena * Perceiving what this pattern explains and predicts | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Darwin's Discovery of Natural Selection What happened: * Observed: Variation in offspring, competition for resources, differential survival, inheritance * Recognized: These mechanisms, operating over time, generate adaptation without design * Saw: Selection as a generative process | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Other examples: * Mendeleev: Organizing elements → recognizing periodic pattern * Kekulé: Benzene structure → recognizing circular/ring pattern * Watson & Crick: DNA → recognizing double helix pattern * Einstein (relativity): Seeing structural equivalence between acceleration and gravity | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | In every case: * Discovery ≠ deriving conclusions from premises * Discovery = seeing structure that wasn't visible before * The seeing IS pattern recognition | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Does Pattern Recognition Mediate Data-Modeling? YES. Reality: You must SEE what kind of pattern might be there * Linear? Exponential? Periodic? Chaotic? Network structure? * Statistical techniques only work once you've recognized what type of pattern to look for | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Training methods: * Immersion: Expose to many examples in domain * Variation: Show same pattern in different contexts * Contrast: Show similar-but-different patterns * Guided attention: Point out relevant features * Practice: Give opportunities to recognize patterns * Feedback: Correct misrecognition, reinforce correct recognition | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | The Upshot Pattern recognition doesn't just describe discovery—it enables and explains it. Discoveries happen when someone recognizes a pattern others missed. | Domains Liberated from Recursive Tyranny
Kuczynski | Detect when statements contradict * Ensure coherence via formal rulesWhat actually happens: * Recognizing contradiction = seeing that statements can't both be true * Pattern recognition of incompatibilityEvidence: * Contradictions can be hidden (people miss them) * Expert logicians better at spotting (trained pattern recognition) * Sometimes requires insight to see inconsistency | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Mathematical case: * Proving system consistency: requires seeing that no derivation could yield P and ¬P * Often requires insight (recognizing structural properties) * Example: Euclidean geometry consistent (give model—you recognize axioms all satisfied)Upshot: Consistency-checking is pattern recognition of compatibility. | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Function 3: Making Predictions / Drawing Consequences What deduction was supposed to do: * Derive conclusions from premises * Follow logical rules mechanicallyWhat actually happens: * Drawing consequences = recognizing what follows from whatScientific case: * Newton's laws + initial conditions → predict positions * Looks deductive. | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | All pattern recognitionUpshot: Drawing consequences is recognizing what-follows-from-what patterns. | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Function 4: Providing Justification / Giving Reasons What deduction was supposed to do: * Justify beliefs by deriving from other beliefs * Build chains of justificationWhat actually happens: * Justification = showing why conclusion is warranted * This is showing the evidential/explanatory patternEvidence: * Good justifications make you SEE why conclusion follows * Bad justifications feel mechanical, don't provide insight * Understanding justification ≠ checking steps mechanicallyUpshot: Justification is making patterns visible, not mechanical derivation. | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Function 5: Ensuring Rigor / Avoiding Error What deduction was supposed to do: * Follow strict rules to avoid mistakes * Mechanical checking ensures correctnessWhat actually happens: * Rigor = careful attention to what follows * Pattern recognition of inferential structure, gaps, assumptionsProof-checking: * Automated: computers verify mechanically * Human: we see whether proof correct (pattern recognition of validity) * But even automated checking was set up by humans who recognized what patterns to check | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Upshot: Rigor is disciplined pattern recognition, not mere rule-following. | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Function 6: Transmitting Certainty / Preserving Knowledge What deduction was supposed to do: * Transfer certainty from premises to conclusion * Knowledge transmitted via valid inferenceWhat actually happens: * Knowledge transmission = recognizing that evidence supports conclusion * Seeing why conclusion is warranted given what you knowEvidence: * Can follow valid argument without understanding (just checking steps) * Real understanding = seeing WHY conclusion follows * This is pattern recognitionUpshot: Knowledge transmission requires recognizing evidential patterns. | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Function 7: Clarifying Concepts / Making Definitions Explicit What deduction was supposed to do: * Analyze: Break complex concepts into simpler components * Define: Give necessary and sufficient conditions * Clarify: Remove ambiguity through formal precisionWhat actually happens: * Conceptual clarification is pattern recognition of meaning-relationships * Defining "bachelor" as "unmarried adult male": Recognize semantic equivalence, see these capture same pattern, perceive no counterexamples | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | This is pattern recognition, not deduction: * Definitions aren't derived; they're recognized as apt * Good definitions capture patterns of use * Testing requires seeing whether they fit casesDeeper point: * Concept formation (creating NEW concepts) clearly non-deductive: * "Natural selection" (Darwin) * "Unconscious" (Freud) * "Information" (Shannon) * Not defined from prior concepts—created by recognizing new patterns | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Upshot: Pattern recognition recovers conceptual work: recognizing semantic relationships, recognizing meaning-patterns, creating new concepts. | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | What Deduction Actually Is Given all the above: DEDUCTION IS NOT A SEPARATE FACULTY OR METHOD. Deduction is a SPECIAL CASE of pattern recognition: * Patterns that are maximally rigid * Context-independent * Exceptionless * Formally codifiableCharacteristics of "deductive" patterns: * Necessity: Pattern admits no exceptions (modus ponens always valid) * Formality: Pattern depends only on logical form, not content * Explicitness: Pattern can be stated as explicit rule * Mechanizability: Pattern can be checked algorithmically (in principle) But even recognizing and applying these patterns requires pattern recognition. | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | The Recovery Thesis Pattern recognition recovers ALL functions attributed to deduction: 1. Truth-preservation (recognizing valid inference) 2. Consistency-checking (recognizing compatibility) 3. Consequence-drawing (recognizing what follows) 4. Justification (showing evidential patterns) 5. Rigor (disciplined pattern recognition) 6. Knowledge-transmission (recognizing support) 7. Conceptual clarity (recognizing meaning-patterns) In every case: * Pattern recognition does the actual cognitive work * Deduction describes a special class of patterns (necessary, formal, explicit) * But recognizing, applying, and verifying deduction requires pattern recognition | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | The Radical Claim Deduction doesn't do ANY work that pattern recognition doesn't do more fundamentally. Even in paradigm deductive domains: Mathematics: * Mathematical intuition is rational (not mystical) * Recognizing unprovable truths (Gödel sentence) * Understanding proofs requires seeing why steps follow * Pattern recognition, not just formal manipulationLogic: * Valid inference forms = codified patterns * But recognizing instances requires pattern recognition * Creating new logics requires seeing new patternsComputer science: * Algorithms = explicit recursive patterns * But designing algorithms requires recognizing problem-patterns * Debugging requires anomaly-detection | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Why This Matters Deduction gets demoted: * Not essence of rationality * Not foundation of knowledge * Just one tool among many (useful in formal contexts)Pattern recognition gets promoted: * Actual mechanism of rational thought * Operates in deduction, induction, abduction, perception * Subsumes what deduction was supposed to doThe theoretical landscape shifts: OLD: * Deduction (primary, foundational) * Induction (secondary, problematic) * Everything else (non-rational)NEW: * Pattern recognition (primary, foundational, rational) * Deduction (special case: rigid formal patterns) * Induction (special case: regularity patterns) * Abduction (special case: explanatory patterns) * All are modes of pattern recognition | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Do You Need Euclid? NO. What Euclid did: * Made geometric reasoning explicit (axioms, definitions, proofs) * Made it teachable (via formal steps) * Made it verifiable (check each step) * Made it transmissible (write down exactly)But the actual geometric insight: * Seeing that triangles with equal sides have equal angles * Recognizing that parallel lines never meet * Perceiving that angles in triangle sum to 180°This is pattern recognition. | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | So: Do you NEED Euclid? For what? * For geometric insight? No. Pattern recognition suffices. * For teaching efficiently? Yes. Formalization helps. * For rigorous proof? Yes. Explicit axiomatization enables verification. * For doing geometry at all? No. People did geometry before and without Euclid. | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | Position 1: UG Is Real But Pattern Recognition Is the Mechanism The view: * Chomsky RIGHT that there's innate linguistic structure * Chomsky RIGHT that syntax is recursive/generative * But mechanism isn't "applying rules"—it's recognizing and producing syntactic patterns * UG = innate pattern-recognition capacity specifically for syntactic structuresNot: "Mind contains rules like 'S → NP + VP'" But: "Mind structured to recognize NP-VP patterns, embedding patterns, agreement patterns" | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | The mechanism: * UG isn't rule-system that gets applied * UG is structured pattern-recognition capacity * Like: Visual system structured to recognize edges, shapes, faces * Not "rules for edge-detection" * But neural architecture that naturally responds to edge-patterns | The Positive Program
Kuczynski | UG alone gives you: * Syntactic structure * Infinite generativity * Well-formed expressions But: * No way to connect to world * No new concepts * No adaptation to novel situations | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | X alone gives you: * Semantic grounding * Reference to world * Concept formation But: * No systematic structure * No infinite expressiveness * Limited to finite learned associations | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Rules as Patterns: Refuting Wittgenstein The Reconciliation: Rule-Application IS Pattern Instantiation KEY INSIGHT: When the mind applies "S → NP + VP", it's not: * Mechanically executing an algorithm * Consulting an internal rulebook * Following a procedure blindly | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Wittgenstein's Rule-Following Paradox THE REGRESS ARGUMENT: To follow rule R, you need to interpret R Interpreting R requires following interpretation-rule R' Following R' requires interpreting R' This requires rule R'' Infinite regress... | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Wittgenstein's conclusion: Rule-following can't be intellectualist (based on interpretation/understanding). It must be: "Just doing it"—blind conformity to training, no principled basis except agreement with community practice. | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | The Refutation via Pattern Recognition THE KEY MOVE: Rule-following doesn't require interpretation when the rule describes a pattern you can directly recognize. | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Pattern recognition is BASIC—not mediated by further rules * Therefore: no regress | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Wittgenstein's puzzle: * Rule: "Add 2" * How do you know to continue: 1000, 1002, 1004... (not 1000, 1004, 1008...)? | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Pattern recognition answer: * You directly recognize the add-2 pattern * The pattern is: each number is 2 more than previous | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Why Pattern Recognition Blocks the Regress The regress requires: * Each step mediated by interpretation * Interpretation requires another rule * That rule requires interpretation * Etc. | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Pattern recognition breaks this: * Recognition is DIRECT (not mediated by interpretation) * No "rule for recognizing patterns" needed * Pattern recognition is GROUND FLOOR (can't regress further) | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Wittgenstein assumes: * Following rule R = interpreting R, then acting on interpretation * Interpretation = applying another rule (R') * Hence regress | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | His answer: * Normativity = community agreement * "Correct" = conforms to what community does * No objective standard beyond social practice | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Pattern recognition answer: * Normativity comes from the pattern itself * Correct = actually instantiates the pattern * Incorrect = produces different pattern * Can be determined by checking instance against pattern | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | The pattern is REAL—recognizing/instantiating it correctly matters objectively. | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Linguists describe those patterns as RULES. But the patterns are real —they're what the mind recognizes and instantiates. | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | OLD VIEW: Rationality = Deduction * Following explicit logical rules * Step-by-step derivation * Algorithmic, recursive * Paradigm: Mathematical proof, formal logic | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | NEW VIEW: Rationality = Pattern Recognition * Seeing structures, similarities, relationships * Holistic judgment * Non-algorithmic but systematic * Paradigm: Scientific discovery, expert diagnosis, skilled perception | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | * Pattern recognition mediates BOTH The General Point Pattern recognition is PRIMARY. Formalization (Euclid, Chomsky, Aristotle, Frege) is SECONDARY. | Rationality as Pattern Recognition
Kuczynski | Kant and Hume on Induction, Causation, and the Methodology of the Human Sciences This paper is divided into three parts. | Introduction
Kuczynski | In the first, we discuss the cogency of Kant’s arguments concerning causation and induction. | Introduction
Kuczynski | Those arguments are spurious, we will find, because they all rest on the erroneous assumption that all non-empirical truths are trivial. | Introduction
Kuczynski | At the same time, so we will also find, each of those arguments corresponds to a cogent argument that does not involve that assumption. | Introduction
Kuczynski | In the second part, we discuss the viability of Hume’s analyses of causation and induction. | Introduction
Kuczynski | It is argued that those analyses are fallacious, and an attempt is made to identify the relevant fallacies. | Introduction
Kuczynski | In the third part, we draw some of the epistemological consequences of our response to Hume. | Introduction
Kuczynski | Kant held that some propositions are both synthetic and also a posteriori. (We will soon define these terms.) | Introduction
Kuczynski | This contention is the heart of the system of thought set forth in the Critique of Pure Reason. | Introduction
Kuczynski | I will now argue that this contention of Kant’s is false and that his argument for it is spurious. | Introduction
Kuczynski | But I will also argue that Kant’s false contention can readily be turned into a correct one and that his spurious argument can readily be turned into a cogent one. | Introduction
Kuczynski | First, I will argue that the premises of Kant’s argument turn out to entail the opposite of the thesis that there are synthetic a priori truths. | Introduction
Kuczynski | Those premises entail that there are virtually no a priori truths, let alone synthetic a priori truths. | Introduction
Kuczynski | Kant fails to distinguish the two quite distinct roles that mental images can have; and his views concerning the synthetic a priori are a reflection of that. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | Kant’s astonishing claims about causality, personal identity, and rationality turn out to be correct and founded on cogent arguments. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | Let us begin with some points about terminology. The word “concept” has two meanings – one logical, one psychological. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | In this paper, I will typically use the word “concept” in its non-psychological sense; and when I describe a proposition as “conceptually necessary”, I mean that it holds entirely in virtue of facts about concepts in the non-psychological sense of the word. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | For Kant, a priority is a property of our knowledge of propositions. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | For Kant, a proposition is “a posteriori” if it is not a priori. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | A sentence is “analytic” exactly if its semantics guarantees its truth. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | Kant uses the term “analytic” to describe propositions – not sentences, and not our knowledge of anything. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | A proposition is synthetic if its truth is not guaranteed by the structures of the concepts composing it. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | For Kant, a+b is larger than a is a paradigm case of an “analytic” proposition, and John and Mary like to play tennis is a paradigm case of a proposition that Kant would describe as “synthetic.” | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | We may conclude that, for Kant, a proposition is “analytic” exactly if it is conceptually true – exactly if it holds entirely in virtue of the structures of the concepts composing it. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | According to Kant, the propositions 7+5=12 and a straight line is the shortest distance between two points are synthetic a priori truths. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | Kant is thus guilty not only of error, but of inconsistency with his own premises, in believing that 7+5=12 is synthetic. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | Given that you don’t think =12 when you think 7+5, it seems to follow that your concept (i.e. your grasp) of 7+5 doesn’t contain or include your concept =12. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | Arithmetical truths are not inductive generalizations that we could, in principle, find to be false. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | How do you know that 7+5=12? Not through conceptual analysis. Not through the senses. You learn it through an act of the imagination. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | By “intuition” Kant means an act of imaging: a kind of para-perception. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | They tell us not that 7+5 really equals 12, but only that we are psychologically compelled to sense-perceive the world as being such that, in it, 7+5=12. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | So intuition doesn’t really tell us anything about the external world. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | The truth is that, on Kant’s account, even this knowledge turns to be a posteriori. | The Cogency of Kant’s Transcendental Arguments
Kuczynski | For Kant, you learn that you can’t represent parallel lines as intersecting by noting that you cannot imagine it; you observe your own mental imagery. | Kant’s Views on Synthetic A Priori Propositions
Kuczynski | When Kant says that “in the phenomenal world” parallels don’t meet, he is just saying that we cannot visually represent a world where parallels don’t meet. | Kant’s Views on Synthetic A Priori Propositions
Kuczynski | Diagrams serve as vehicles for a priori reasoning. | Kant’s Views on Synthetic A Priori Propositions
Kuczynski | This knowledge turns out to be quite a posteriori. | Kant’s Views on Synthetic A Priori Propositions
Kuczynski | One is guilty of incoherence if one thinks that (*) is false. | Kant’s Views on Synthetic A Priori Propositions
Kuczynski | Because we have certain cognitive machinery -- certain “forms of thought” -- we are compelled to see the world in a certain way. | Kant’s Views on Synthetic A Priori Propositions
Kuczynski | If you believe (d), you are guilty of logical incoherence: the proposition you believe entails a contradiction. | Kant’s Views on Synthetic A Priori Propositions
Kuczynski | Logical coherence is a relation among concepts. Psychological coherence is a relation among our grasp of concepts. | Kant’s Views on Synthetic A Priori Propositions
Kuczynski | What Kant refers to as ‘synthetic a priori’ truths are nothing other than what we are describing as hard analytic truths. | Kant’s Views on Synthetic A Priori Propositions
Kuczynski | Given only the fact that there are beings who have the ability to raise questions about anything, let alone about the necessary preconditions for experience, it follows that causal relations do not consist in mere sequences of events, but in internal relations of some kind. | Kant’s Views on Synthetic A Priori Propositions
Kuczynski | Kant himself proposed solutions. But those solutions falsely presuppose that the world known to us and studied by science is a creation of our own mental faculties. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | The justification for this inference would have to be empirical, not strictly logical. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | But there can be no such assurance unless there is an assurance that the future resembles the past. We are evidently caught in an unbreakable, vicious circle. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | There are no necessary, and therefore no causal, relations between distinct events, or at least none we could have any legitimate reason to believe in. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | But what we perceive does not give us any basis for perceiving that things altogether different from events are likely to accompany events. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | Given this, we might say that a causal connection consists in the operation of some force that demands the existence of the one event, given the existence of the other. But this is not a tenable proposal. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | If by “force” is meant some constituent of the spatio-temporal world, then there can be no legitimate reason to believe in its existence, as the following argument shows. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | To take a trivial example, this would be the case if we described A as the cause of B or if we described B as one of the successors of A. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | Focus on an arbitrary one of these mass-energy displacements. To give a complete description of this displacement, we must obviously describe what happens during some stretch of time, however short that stretch may be. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | This would have two consequences. First it would mean that any description of any given event would include a description of subsequent events. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | It might seem to meaningful to say that x is a square at instant t. After all, squareness is (it seems) a three-, not a four-dimensional property. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | But this involves a confusion of the having of four-dimensional properties with the gaining and losing of such properties. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | The belief that space and time are composed of points strikes me as a projection into the physical world of this fact about language. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | Hume’s analysis of the concept of “force” is beyond reproach. But that analysis is moot since, contrary to what Hume held, we don’t need forces to connect cause and effect. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | Finally, those descriptions never mention the fact that the data that motivates (and, so I will argue, justifies) our inductive beliefs is never, in the final analysis, propositional. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | If there is no possible causal connection between E and E*, then it makes little sense to say that they have any spatial or temporal position with respect to each other. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | It seems, then, that (O) is less like all and only rhenates are chordates than it is like all and only triangles are regions bounded by three coplanar lines such that any two of them, but not all three, intersect. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | Hume famously argued that there are no strictly logical grounds for the view that every event must have a cause – that there are no ex nihilo events. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | The spatio-temporal manifold would comprise ex nihilo (uncaused) events only if it comprised events that were not co-located with other events – only if it comprised events that it didn’t comprise. | Critique of Kant’s Psychological Necessity
Kuczynski | Hume’s conception of causality involves a falsely “digital” conception of spatiotemporal reality. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | The spatio-temporal world is thus, almost by definition, completely permutation-friendly. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | The permutation-friendliness definitive of spatio-temporal location, as Hume understands it, is identical with the absence of causal connections between distinct states of affairs. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | Spatio-temporal continuity is a form of persistence. Consequently, continuity is a causal phenomenon. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | Hume’s “demonstration” that there are no causal relations (or that such relations reduce to regularities) is thus an artifact of his assumption that space and time have a structure comparable to that of an array of digits. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | Strictly speaking, it is not our knowledge of (a)-(a4), or of any other propositions, that motivates and justifies our inductions: what does so is the sensory data that those propositions so schematically model. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | What is reported by such a proposition is not the content of the perception itself, but rather a judgment about the content of that perception. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | The logical basis for induction is precisely what is lost in the process of digitization involved in embodying one’s knowledge in (a)-(a4). | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | When you see a white swan, what your perception gives you is a continuous state of affairs. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | There is thus a sense in which (a)-(a4) are not the data that motivate (or legitimate) belief in (b). | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | What is given to you in such representations is never a discrete state but, at most, a relatively discrete state of affairs. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | Hume holds that counter-inductive beliefs like (A) involve unusual, but otherwise acceptable, permutations of objects and properties. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | Hume rightly said that (A) and (C) are compatible propositions. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | It is tempting to think that (A) is logically incompatible with the existence of known facts, like that described by: (C) no stone known to anyone has ever sprouted wings. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | Hume’s conception of induction involves a similar fallacy. | Hume’s Analysis of Induction and Causality
Kuczynski | our answers typically don’t go much beyond what those associations give us. | Revisiting the Analogue-Digital Distinction
Kuczynski | Given that association is an affect-driven process, it is to be expected that it will refer us to emotionally pregnant breakdowns in the uptake of perceptual information, and not to the smooth flow of information mediating between such cataclysms. | Revisiting the Analogue-Digital Distinction
Kuczynski | Hume’s views on induction are thus artifacts of his own methods. | Revisiting the Analogue-Digital Distinction
Kuczynski | Our experience gives us smooth curves. Our sentential representations of our experience (“past fires have been hot”) give us isolated points that are compatible with infinitely many different curves. | Revisiting the Analogue-Digital Distinction
Kuczynski | the viability of induction is bound up with the existence of causal mechanisms linking states of affairs. | Revisiting the Analogue-Digital Distinction
Kuczynski | Our acceptance of Hume’s analyses of causation and induction, despite their obvious discordance with everything we believe, is a special case of that acquiescence and is thus an expression of that same wish. | Revisiting the Analogue-Digital Distinction
Kuczynski | Correct inductions are analogue-logically valid inferences from the data embodied in our sense-perceptions. | Revisiting the Analogue-Digital Distinction
Kuczynski | Hume’s counter-intuitive analysis of causation presupposes that spatio-temporal relations are non-causal, and thus that space and time are empty vessels whose properties are wholly invariant with respect to those of the events populating them. | Revisiting the Analogue-Digital Distinction
Kuczynski | Once it is acknowledged that temporal co-locatedness must be understood in causal terms, we have no trouble finding a purely logical foundation for our inductive practices. | Revisiting the Analogue-Digital Distinction
Kuczynski | a belief that is very likely to be correct is not, in virtue of that fact, knowledge. | Logical Basis of Induction
Kuczynski | Our knowledge of the external world is not merely probable. Our beliefs concerning the external world analogue-logically valid inferences from the data of experience. | Logical Basis of Induction
Kuczynski | space and time are themselves causal notions. | Logical Basis of Induction
Kuczynski | For E to come before E* is for E is to be a cause of E*. For those events to be simultaneous is for neither to be a cause of the other. | Logical Basis of Induction
Kuczynski | if E1 has no causal relation to E2, then (unless they are simultaneous) they are ipso facto not parts of the same event. | Logical Basis of Induction
Kuczynski | an instant in time is the class of all events such that there is no causal connection between any two of them. | Logical Basis of Induction
Kuczynski | Conceptual, i.e. analytic connections, betoken an identity, or overlap, of content. | Logical Basis of Induction
Kuczynski | Whenever we talk about “the same place”, we must identify the relevant framework. | Logical Basis of Induction
Kuczynski | Evolution becomes an all purpose explanatory stop-gap, much as God used to be. | Logical Basis of Induction
Kuczynski | in the final analysis, Chomsky and Kant say that, give or take a few nuances, we are born knowing everything we will ever know. | Logical Basis of Induction
Kuczynski | Humean empiricism is inconsistent with this; and so, despite first appearances, is Chomskyan-Kantian nativism. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | Their nativism is not rationalism; it is species-empiricism, as opposed to individual-empiricism; and, notwithstanding the appearance of scientific rigor associated with the hallowed term “evolution”, their position is as incapable as Hume’s in allowing us to have any theoretical or inductive knowledge. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | Hume makes it impossible to acquire any knowledge that transcends the deliverances of one’s senses at a given moment. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | Since we can’t learn anything, we must be born knowing everything that we ever come to know. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | But there is another – in this context, much more important – kind of innate knowledge. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | The cognitive machinery through which we acquire empirical knowledge would seem to be embody knowledge of conceptual truths. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | Some kind of knowledge is needed to see relations of bearing among empirical data and, thus, to synthesize such data into theories (and even – I believe, following Kant and David Marr – into perceptions). | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | The kind of knowledge that enables one to delineate the logical consequences of the information at one’s disposal is entirely analytic and non-empirical. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | It therefore isn’t necessary to agree with the implausible view of Kant and Chomsky that we innately know Newtonian mechanics, and need only a modicum of sense-experience to activate this latent knowledge. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | Fortunately, it isn’t necessary to posit so much innate empirical knowledge to explain our success at forming theories. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | There are obviously some cases where the cause of a belief is distinct from its justification. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | On Hume’s view, nothing causes anything. Instead of causation, there are only regularities. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | To explain an event is thus to show only that it is an instance of some regularity. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | If we accept Hume’s views on induction, then this is exactly what we are forced to say. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | Psychological explanation, it is said, consists in entering into the subjectivity of the person or persons studied. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | But the word “explanation” is not ambiguous – it is not like the word “bank”. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | In both cases, you are showing why it makes sense that some event occurred. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | Explanation always consists in showing a logical and principled relation between initial and terminal conditions. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | Exceptionless though they are, these regularities are obviously explanatorily irrelevant. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | As Clarence Lewis stressed in Mind and the World Order, for something to be copper (or water, or a table, or a bar of soap…) specifically is for it to have the right inductive and explanatory properties. | Consequences for Scientific Explanation
Kuczynski | One lesson of this discussion is that, contrary to what Hume alleges, explanation is not a purely statistical concept, since the terms in which the relevant statistics are articulated will inevitably be explanatorily committed. | Skepticism and the External World
Kuczynski | The physical world is characterized by many regularities (leaving aside the explanatorily sterile ones just discussed). But presumably these regularities express, and do not constitute, the existence of principled relationships. | Skepticism and the External World
Kuczynski | Our inhibitions to doing so vanish once we acknowledge the two main points of this paper, namely: propositions are merely models, and bad ones at that, of the analogue data given in sense-perception; and, second, space and time are not causally innocuous concepts. | Skepticism and the External World
Kuczynski | Revolutionary science consists in producing a new “paradigm”: a new framework within which research is to be conducted. A paradigm is not exactly a theory; it would be better described as a kind of meta-theory – a general outlook within which the construction of theories takes place. | Skepticism and the External World
Kuczynski | In Kuhn’s view, since facts are all internal to paradigms, empirical facts cannot warrant the acceptance or rejection of a given paradigm. Paradigms are to be accepted or rejected entirely on non-epistemic grounds. | Skepticism and the External World
Kuczynski | If Kuhn is right, then once a paradigm is accepted, all the important issues have been decided in advance. So once a paradigm is accepted, scientific research consists in delineating the consequences of what is, from the viewpoint of someone operating within that paradigm, some trans-empirical and thus a priori set of categories. | Skepticism and the External World
Kuczynski | The debate between Kuhn and the positivists parallels the debate regarding psychological explanation between Dilthey and Hempel. On the one hand, we have a sterile and implausible descriptivist conception of scientific explanation: theories are statistical generalizations; to explain an event is to subsume it under such a generalization. | Skepticism and the External World
Kuczynski | Inductive explanation consists in finding principled relationships among data. The relevant logical principles are embodied in analogue-content, and thus resist articulation within the more familiar digital-propositional logic on which we focus in philosophical discourse. | Skepticism and the External World
Kuczynski | Hume’s statistical conception of explanation is false; and so, therefore, is his solution to the mind-body problem. | Skepticism and the External World
Kuczynski | Whether Freud’s theories are to be accepted is a strictly empirical question that is to be resolved wholly on the basis of the accuracy of the specific contents of those theories. | Skepticism and the External World
Kuczynski | Once it is agreed that we came into existence by a process of evolution, it becomes hard to maintain that we were created by an almighty God. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | There is at least one other reason why the theory of evolution upsets us. It makes it very hard to believe in an afterlife. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | If four pairs of shoes all have the same logo on them, they were probably made by the same company. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | We don’t believe that amoebas or lizards or baboons go to heaven. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | Every human being, when confronted with two very similar things, instinctively looks for a common cause. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | In fact, it is painfully obvious that we are related to such creatures. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | Of course, people didn’t know about evolution at a conscious level. They repressed this knowledge; they knew it only unconsciously. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | But when we look at the anatomical basis of love, this sine qua non of the good life - -this highest actualization of the human spirit – takes on quite a different countenance. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | So given that we evolved from such creatures, or from creatures of their ilk, it seems very arbitrary to maintain that we go to heaven when we die. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | One hypothesis is: I have an ‘implicit grasp’ of certain grammatical rules; I have mastered rules governing what concatenations of sound betoken well-formed sentences of English; | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | though sex, at least in certain contexts, is believed, supposedly, to be the highest manifestation of the human condition, it is also, evidently believed to be the lowest. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | The fact that I use a diagram to prove the intermediate value theorem or the Pythagorean theorem doesn’t prove that either of those theorems is synthetic. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | If somebody asks me “what is the minimum number of sides a solid can have?”, I base my answer on a mental image that I produce. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | The need for those contextualizing is the proof positive that we are animals and that Darwin is right. | Conception and Causation Overview
Kuczynski | It is a contradictio in adjecto to speak of non-conscious mental phenomena; the essence of mentality is consciousness. | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | As I will try to show, one error in it is the idea that the sub-personal cognition posited by cognitive scientists necessarily involves a private language. | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | Wittgenstein held (i) that what we call ‘grasping’ propositions really consists in knowing a language and (ii) that one must be a member of a community to know a language. | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | Rules are like maps: maps don’t tell you where to go: you figure out where to go by consulting a map. | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | So grasping a norm doesn’t consist in being in possession of some kind of internal icon corresponding to that norm. | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | Basically, to understand a verbal symbol, e.g. a sentence, is to know how use it in a way that is consistent with conventional usage of it: | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | We will soon enough discuss at some length why private languages are held to be impossible. | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | Grasping a proposition does not, in Wittgenstein’s view, consist in being aware of anything. | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | A private language is an absurdity. Only a creature that belongs to a community can speak a language. | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | For the record, my own view is that knowing-how does reduce to knowing-that — that knowing how play the piano or do math does consist in internally representing various rules and is thus comparable to knowledge of a fact. | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | But Fred uses L only to communicate with himself; so no one besides Fred will punish his incorrect uses of expressions of L. | The Nature of Emotions and Ethics
Kuczynski | One cannot say anything without expressing some belief that one has – without showing something about one’s own beliefs and, therefore, about oneself. | Critique of Kant's Views
Kuczynski | Suppose that emotivism is correct. Given only that emotivism is correct, it doesn’t follow that, in saying ‘x is good’ or ‘x is bad’, one is not also making a true or false statement about x. | Critique of Kant's Views
Kuczynski | Now if there is a language of thought, one could not know this language simply by memorizing the meanings of its expressions. | Critique of Kant's Views
Kuczynski | Now if Fodor’s counter-objection (quoted above) is correct, then you never figure out what Mentalese expressions mean. | Critique of Kant's Views
Kuczynski | These rules, by Tarski’s theorem, cannot be stated in L’’, but must be stated in some other language L’’’ – and so on ad infinitum. | Critique of Kant's Views
Kuczynski | For me to grasp the Mentalese sentence if snow is white, then something is white I must obviously grasp the Mentalese sentences snow is white and something is white and I must also grasp the relation that these two sentences bear to the sentence if snow is white, then something is white. | Critique of Kant's Views
Kuczynski | But if Fodor’s objection is correct, (i’) is not – at least nor from your point of view: from the point of view the person who has to figure out what (i’) means - semantically complex; its meaning is not to be computed in any way. | Critique of Kant's Views
Kuczynski | To understand a sentence token is to know what meaning it bears; and what meaning it bears is, ultimately, determined by what is meant by it or, at any rate, by what is meant – by what thought is intended to be conveyed - by the primitive expressions occurring in it. | Critique of Kant's Views
Kuczynski | Given this, it follows trivially that one cannot know a language without knowing the semantical rules for it. | Critique of Kant's Views
Kuczynski | If we think in a language, then the morphemes of Mentalese are the basic units of our thought. | Critique of Kant's Views
Kuczynski | We’ve just encountered yet another problem with that view. It is clear that triangles have three sides and squares have four sides and Jim’s pool has three sides all have something in common, corresponding to the fact that side is a constituent of all of them. | Cognitive Realism and Language
Kuczynski | But the concept side is not in any clear sense a constituent of a set of worlds. | Cognitive Realism and Language
Kuczynski | The fact that a grasp of a single concept or property is used in grasping different propositions suggests that propositions are built up out of concepts or properties. | Cognitive Realism and Language
Kuczynski | So we are vindicated, I think, in holding that propositions – if they exist – just are structures consisting of properties (concepts). | Cognitive Realism and Language
Kuczynski | Most importantly, practically no anti-propositionalists would want to say that “triangles have three sides” is made true by facts about platonic entities. | Cognitive Realism and Language
Kuczynski | For belief in such entities is very much not in the spirit of antipropositionalism. | Cognitive Realism and Language
Kuczynski | To sum up, the anti-propositionalist is barred from saying that facts about platonic entities make (T) be true. | Cognitive Realism and Language
Kuczynski | A proposition is a set of properties, and a proposition is true if the relevant properties are instantiated. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | The ordered triple <Plato, the relation of punching, Socrates> isn’t true or false. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | A sentence is not just a heap of referring terms. A corresponding point holds about propositions. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | A proposition is a set of objects and properties that are unified in some way. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | The difference between a proposition and a non-propositional heap is somehow coded in these grammatical articulations. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | The proposition Socrates punched Plato has a unique decomposition into minimal parts. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | The expression “punches” corresponds to something with holes in it; these holes enable Smith and Jones to link up with that thing in the appropriate way. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | Frege’s “solution” is really just a way of labeling the problem, as Davidson [380] said. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | Let me start out by stating, in extremely rough outline, the position I will defend. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | I will argue that propositions are unordered sets of properties. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | These points help us deal with another important fact. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | The sentence “Smith punches Jones” encodes an arrangement of objects and properties. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | In that case, the proposition that Smith punches Jones consists of Smith, Jones, and the relation of punching being arranged in a certain way. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | Are grammatical articulations referring terms with the special property that the things to which they refer confer unity on what would otherwise an unordered heap? | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | If the proposition that Smith punches Jones consist of Smith’s punching Jones, then the mere existence of that proposition guarantees that Smith is punching Jones. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | The sentence is isomorphic with the proposition. The proposition is isomorphic with state of affairs. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | What occurs in the proposition appears to be simply Jones. Of course, the proposition goes on to ascribe a property to Jones. But Jones’ occurrence in that proposition is unpropertied. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | Consider the set of worlds where Socrates is tall. Socrates isn’t a constituent of that set in remotely the sense in which, by all appearances, he is a constituent of that Socrates is tall. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | What we want to know – what Frege doesn’t tell us – is what this metaphor is a metaphor for. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | If that set’s sole member is P, then those facts are eclipsed; the set doesn’t have the right decomposition. | Wittgenstein's Influence
Kuczynski | none of Kripke’s (or Putnam’s) semantic insights threaten the idea that one’s ability to use an expression that refers to Socrates embodies knowledge of a true proposition of the form: something x uniquely has phi, and “Socrates” refers to x. | Brandom's Extension of Wittgenstein
Kuczynski | In principle, one can hear the sound without knowing the meaning. (This would happen if you didn’t speak the relevant language or if you had sustained brain-damage of a certain kind.) | Brandom's Extension of Wittgenstein
Kuczynski | if you know what (to switch examples) “Hesperus” refers to, it is by way of some existence claim, which might be something like: (#H) yesterday there was a unique star x such that I was gazing at x and x alone remained in the morning sky after all the others had disappeared; moreover “Hesperus” names x. | Brandom's Extension of Wittgenstein
Kuczynski | For exactly similar reasons, what “Phosphorous is lovely” conveys to you will be something like: (#PL) yesterday there was a unique star x such that I was gazing at x and x alone appeared in the evening sky before all the other stars; moreover “Phosphorous” names x; and x is lovely. | Brandom's Extension of Wittgenstein
Kuczynski | In connection with this, our analysis is consistent with the fact that you also have the right intuitions about the modal status of the proposition meant by (*) and also about the modal properties of the thing named by “Hesperus”. | Brandom's Extension of Wittgenstein
Kuczynski | So, on our account, when you think Hesperus has phi, you are really thinking: (*****) something x in fact has the property of uniquely being a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky, and x has phi. | Brandom's Extension of Wittgenstein
Kuczynski | Let us suppose, once again, that the proposition through which you assign “Hesperus” to Hesperus (Venus) is this: (#H) yesterday there was a unique star x such that I was gazing at x and x alone remained in the morning sky after all the others had disappeared; moreover “Hesperus” names x. | Brandom's Extension of Wittgenstein
Kuczynski | Our case for this position will not presuppose the correctness of this or that interpretation of Brandom or of Wittgenstein. | Brandom's Extension of Wittgenstein
Kuczynski | So it is indeed through some kind of existence claim that I hook up the name to the right person: there is some guy x who was just pointed out to me, and whom I am now looking it, who is over there on the jungle gyms, wearing a hat with a propeller on it…and “Sam” names x. | Brandom's Extension of Wittgenstein
Kuczynski | Snow is white’, ‘2+2=4’, ‘2+2=5’ are conventionalized ways of expressing things that could be the object of belief. | Conclusion and Implications
Kuczynski | A sentence is significant if it is such that it is a conventionalized way of encoding a potential belief or disbelief. | Conclusion and Implications
Kuczynski | In any case, whatever complications may connect with my analysis of literal meaning, I would be very surprised if these really undermined what I have to say about the relationship between emotivism and moral realism. | Conclusion and Implications
Kuczynski | It is obvious, at the very least, Hume is quite wrong to say that (e.g.) anger contains no ‘reference to any other object’: I am angry, I am angry at Bob or Sally or Fred. | Conclusion and Implications
Kuczynski | There is some kind of connection between e.g. hating someone – which is non-occurrent and, in and of itself, has no phenomenal content – and having certain negative ‘feelings’ in the narrow, purely phenomenal sense of this word. | Conclusion and Implications
Kuczynski | Being able to identify an object is being able to connect it to background knowledge. | Conclusion and Implications

Author Unknown | The US had good reasons to enter the war. | Politics and Historical Analysis
Author Unknown | These reasons were primarily economic in nature: the American economy stood to gain if the U.S. entered the war and stood to lose if it didn’t. | Politics and Historical Analysis
Author Unknown | First of all, the U.S. fell into a massive recession, but War lifted the US out of this recession by creating a large market for American military goods. | Politics and Historical Analysis
Author Unknown | So the American economy came to depend on the war. | Politics and Historical Analysis
Author Unknown | The canonical answer to the question “Why did the US enter WW1?” is: “Because of German attacks on American vessels, coupled with the Zimmerman letter.” | Politics and Historical Analysis
Author Unknown | The real causes lay in Wilson’s psychology—specifically in his concern for his deteriorating public image. | Politics and Historical Analysis
Author Unknown | Also, in order to make it possible for the Allies to pay for American goods, a number of American financiers, including J.P. Morgan, loaned them a large amount of money, which said financiers would probably not recover if the Allies lost. | Politics and Historical Analysis
Author Unknown | If the US didn’t enter the war, then at least arguably its safety and territorial integrity were at risk. | Politics and Historical Analysis
Author Unknown | But Germany was not a military threat to the US, as it simply did not have the ability, in terms of technology or manpower, to conduct war with a power of the US’s stature from such a great distance off. | Politics and Historical Analysis

Unknown | If medical records cease to be treated as private, then doctor-patient confidentiality is undermined, leading to a true public health crisis. | Psychology and Behavioral Analysis
Unknown | The law requires patients to sign over their medical records to third parties, the alternative being non-receipt of medical care, and their doing so does not constitute a legitimately tendered waiver of Constitutional Protections. | Psychology and Behavioral Analysis

Unknown | Using the Controlled Substances Act, or any other law or “statutory regime”, as a justification for undermining doctor-patient privilege would cause a true public health hazard. | Psychology and Behavioral Analysis
Unknown | Without doctor-patient confidentiality, many people who need medical attention either altogether avoid physicians and therefore won’t receive it or will withhold critical information physicians and therefore won’t receive the care they need. | Psychology and Behavioral Analysis

Kuczynski | It must therefore be concluded that, at present, any dialing up of caffeine-related regulations are contraindicated. | Education and Knowledge Management
Kuczynski | Currently the sale of caffeine is almost completely unregulated, and there is no evidence of any kind that children or anyone else is being harmed as a result. | Education and Knowledge Management
Kuczynski | The result of such restrictions would be an unwelcome and useless encroachment of government on the private sector, with no foreseeable gain for any demographic. | Education and Knowledge Management
Kuczynski | Also, the introduction of such regulations would be especially thorny, given the fact that it is the active ingredient in many medications, including every single OTC medicine for migraine headaches and premenstrual syndrome. | Education and Knowledge Management
Kuczynski | Of course, the government could counter-respond by prohibiting the sale of Excedrin and other such medications, but nothing but suffering and inconvenience would come of any such prohibition, as anyone suffering from a migraine or from premenstrual syndrome knows all too well. | Education and Knowledge Management
Kuczynski | Restrictions on the sale of caffeine, if enforced, would require a veritable army of regulators and would also debilitate a wide variety of businesses. | Education and Knowledge Management

Kuczynski | An empirical discipline is one whose findings, when justified, are justified by their consistency with sensory observation. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | Any given empirical discipline makes assumptions that cannot be justified by that discipline or, indeed, by any empirical discipline. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | In general our sensory experiences can provide only a relative justification for the judgments we make about this or that specific perception: relative to the assumption that those experiences are typically accurate, inferences can be made as to the degree of accuracy of this or that particular perception. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | Physics cannot possibly justify that presupposition, and neither, for the very same reason, can any other empirical discipline. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | It is the task, not of the scientist, but of the meta-scientist---of the philosopher, in other words---to provide that justification. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | The assumption that our senses are a viable source of information about the external world is but one of many assumptions on which empirical knowledge rests but for which no empirical justification can be provided and for which, therefore, a philosophical justification must be provided. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | One reason for this is that it is a non-empirical discipline. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | Mathematics is a non-empirical discipline. But it isn’t regarded with suspicion. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | People often assume that, like physics, mathematics must be empirical. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | Our sensory have two quite distinct roles in the acquisition of knowledge: an information-transmitting role and a thought-triggering role. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | It turns out that your visual perceptions of the chalkboard were hallucinatory. Does it follow that you don’t know that a triangle’s area is ½ its base times its height? No. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | Since that thought-process was itself impeccable, even though it was initiated by hallucinations, the result was indeed knowledge of BH. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | A story will help put these points into focus. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science
Kuczynski | No. Those visual experiences merely prompted the thought-process that led to your accepting BH. | Introduction: Philosophy as the Science of Science

Kuczynski | Falsificationism is really a version of verificationism. According to verificationism, S is meaningful if verifiable. According to falsificationism, S is meaningful if S’s negation is verifiable. | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | In light of the failure of falsificationism, advocates of LP decided to soften their views about meaningfulness one more time. This time, they said that a non-tautologous statement is meaningful if possible observations can confirm it. | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | Confirmationalism is equivalent with the position that all meaningful non-tautologous statements are empirical. | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | An empirical statement is one that, if true, expresses a truth that must be known through observation and that, if false, is the negation of a true empirical statement. | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | The negation of an empirical statement is an empirical statement. | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | This is because, if it’s an empirical question whether or not S is true, then it’s an empirical question whether or not S is false, and therefore whether or not not-S is true. | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | Henceforth when we refer to “logical positivism” (LP), we will refer to the position that a statement S is meaningful if and only if (i) S is a tautology (e.g., “sisters are female siblings”) or (ii) S is an empirical statement (e.g., “there are trees in Santa Barbara”). | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | Consider the statement: (1) “Triangles are three sided figures.” (1) is plausibly seen as being true by convention. The same is true of: (2) “Pentagons have five sides.” | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | But (3) clearly isn’t a conventional truth. Though it follows from conventions, (3) is not itself a convention. (3) is thus a non-tautologous, non-empirical truth. | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | To say that P is inconsistent with Q is to say that P must be false if Q is true. Observation cannot tell you what must be the case; it can tell you, at most, what is the case. | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | A proposition is logically true if the laws of logic prohibit its negation from being true. | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | Logical truths are never sentences; they’re always propositions, and propositions are never conventionally true. | The Main Confusion Underlying Empiricism
Kuczynski | Propositions are sets of properties; and a proposition is true just in case the properties that are members of it are instantiated --so what it is for a proposition to be true is for the members of the set with which it is identical to be jointly instantiated. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | The property of being identical with something that is smoking and is identical with Tommy. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | It is indisputable that 1 is true just in case C is instantiated. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | A's being instantiated is necessary but not sufficient for C's being instantiated, the same being true of B's being instantiated. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | This is consistent with, and even corroborates, the thesis that 1 is S that and that 1's being true is S's members' being jointly instantiated. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | It follows that 1 is true if, and only if, each of A, B, and C is instantiated. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | The quantum-ripples on which the truth of a proposition supervenes don't have anything like the structure of that proposition. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | On one of its two disambiguations, it says that there are ideas that are both colorless and green, all of them furious sleepers. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | Such an instance is, to adapt Kenneth Taylor's (1998) apt expression, a dent or ripple in the quantum; it is a shift in the movement of mass-energy. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | The neat articulations found in 1 are found, in some form, in S. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | While none of this demonstrates definitively that 1 is identical with S or that 1's being true is identical with S's members' being jointly instantiated, we have, I believe, found enough of a match between 1/1's being true and S/S's members' being instantiated to warrant looking into the idea that they might be one and the same. | Philosophical Textbooks and Their Limitations
Kuczynski | The problem is that his grasp of those principles is being inhibited by shortcomings that in no way detract from his semantic competence, even though they do limit his ability to deploy it. | Psychological and Sociological Factors in Philosophy
Kuczynski | Wittgenstein’s idea that meanings, if grasped, must be interpreted reflects his erroneous belief that, whenever one can’t see a consequence of some principle that one grasps, it’s because one hasn’t adequately interpreted that principle. | Psychological and Sociological Factors in Philosophy
Kuczynski | But principles aren’t interpreted. They’re grasped. And, if grasped, they guide judgments. | Psychological and Sociological Factors in Philosophy
Kuczynski | But given what we’ve seen, we have no reason to reject the plausible, if not self-evident, position that thinking is a psychological act. | Psychological and Sociological Factors in Philosophy
Kuczynski | But, of course, Wittgenstein doesn’t see it this way. Believing himself to have definitively established (the radically absurd principle) that rule-following and, more generally, thought aren’t mental processes; he attempts to show that there can be no private languages. | Psychological and Sociological Factors in Philosophy
Kuczynski | If he takes X35 to mean that the sun is out, his interpretation of X35 will be inconsistent with his Monday intentions. | Psychological and Sociological Factors in Philosophy
Kuczynski | An English-speaker can’t just decide that “snow is white” means that grass is green. For it is the thoughts and practices of people in general, and not of this or that specific person, that determines what is meant by “snow is white.” | Psychological and Sociological Factors in Philosophy
Kuczynski | The reason that expressions of English (or any other public language) are meaningful is that people remember what they mean. | Psychological and Sociological Factors in Philosophy
Kuczynski | It’s an interesting question how they ought to be interpreted. | Psychological and Sociological Factors in Philosophy
Kuczynski | “If one has grounds for believing something,” it is said, “one knows what those grounds are.” | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | But it does follow that not all intuitive thought is bad. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | Given that scientific breakthroughs result largely from intuitive thought and often themselves take the form of intuitions, philosophers of science have no choice but to see the generation of discoveries as having no connection, or only a fortuitous connection, to the eventual justification of them. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | A skillful interrogator may know why he believes that the suspect is lying but not be able to say why he thinks this. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | In any case, even though Max’s belief is thoroughly justified, it could be said that Max has “failed to justify” it. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | When epistemologists say that a belief is justified, they mean that the person who has it is justified in having it. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | Skepticism is doubt, not disbelief. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | David Hume made it clear why it may be doubted whether inductive inference ever leads to knowledge. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | Nobody denies that inductive inferences are knowledge-conducive and, therefore, that the conclusion of Hume’s argument is false. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | It is thus the principle that nature is uniform—or, as we’ll call it, the uniformity principle (UP)—that allows us to make rational, non-deductive inferences about the unknown on the basis of the known. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | All cases of induction by enumeration, when legitimate, are parasitic on cases of inference to the best explanation. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | Any knowledge that one has of UP must be inferential. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | This would be a case of induction by enumeration. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | A corollary is the point (which we stressed but which some philosophers of science deny) that bad hypotheses can be correct ones. | Case Studies: Philosophical Orthodoxy and Critique
Kuczynski | The things we describe as “causes” are really partial causes. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | It is a matter of philosophical and scientific debate whether, given an event E happening at t, anything other than the entire state of the universe just prior to t can be the complete cause of E. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | In a word, “the cause” of an event is an INUS-condition for that event. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | Thus, Smith’s being drunk was an insufficient but non-redundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition for his crashing. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | J.L. Mackie (1917–1981) made it clear what is meant by “the cause of E,” as this expression is typically used. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | If, as Aristotle seems to think, final causes are goals per se, he’s wrong to describe them as causes. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | So-called formal causes don’t hold between events (or states of affairs) or statements; they hold between things. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | Without this expression, or some equivalent, it would be very hard to say anything meaningful about causal explanation—or about non-causal explanation, for that matter. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | Dependence-relations hold between propositions, as opposed to things. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | Functionalism is discussed at length in Chapter 22. But a few words on it here are appropriate. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | Content-externalism embodies a failure to appreciate the concept meant by the phrase “in virtue of.” | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | What Smith’s eyes tell him isn’t that Mary is tall. They tell him that a person who has certain features is tall. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | Given almost any known instance of one event’s causing another to occur, the one event is the program-cause, not the efficient cause, of the other. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | Frank Jackson (1943-) and Philip Pettit (1945–) have shown this to be false. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | Program-causality is therefore central to the concepts of prediction and explanation and, thus, to the theory of knowledge. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | The concept of efficient causality clearly is a coherent one. | Analytic Philosophy as Logical Analysis
Kuczynski | Given that Smith hasn’t shown up yet, he’s probably not going to show up at all | Frege's Insight and the Role of Logical Form
Kuczynski | Statements affirming the probability of hypotheses seldom even appear capable of statistical interpretations. | Frege's Insight and the Role of Logical Form
Kuczynski | we have a pretty good idea of what at least some of the consequences of detonating a hydrogen bomb over the South Pole would be, even though nothing much like that has ever occurred. | Frege's Insight and the Role of Logical Form
Kuczynski | A precondition for making the right inferences is knowing what the relevant kinds of similarity are. | Frege's Insight and the Role of Logical Form
Kuczynski | Changes in temperature aren’t changes in position. Nor are changes in color, shape, or structure. | Frege's Insight and the Role of Logical Form
Kuczynski | It is (alleged) truths that are explained. Facts and events are explained only in the indirect sense that true propositions about them are explained. | Frege's Insight and the Role of Logical Form
Kuczynski | Moving on: Unless the continuities that we posit in the hopes of explaining T are expressed by propositions consisting of concepts belonging to the same family of concepts to which those constituting T belong we haven’t established continuity within our models of events. | Frege's Insight and the Role of Logical Form
Kuczynski | Disciplines are individuated only secondarily, and sometimes not at all, by the facts that they describe. | Frege's Insight and the Role of Logical Form
Kuczynski | Astronomy is not a department of microphysics. In fact, those disciplines are disjoint, or nearly so. | Frege's Insight and the Role of Logical Form
Kuczynski | The concept of explanatory integrity is to be understood in terms of the concept of causal integrity. | Frege's Insight and the Role of Logical Form
Kuczynski | What shows up on the Enterprise isn’t him; it is, at most, a doppelganger. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | My students often object to this. Here’s their argument: “Teleporting Capt. Kirk involves transforming his energy into a new form, and then, at the target location, converting that same energy back into the old form.” | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | a continuous causal process that mediates drastic structural changes may not be enough for identity. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | The degree of structural resemblance between me and the zygote that eventually turned into me is far greater than the structural resemblance between the Phase 2 atom-scatter and the Phase 3 Enterprise occupant. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | Once gone, always gone Let’s map these points onto our points about teleportation. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | But what if I’m frozen and kept in ice for a thousand years, and then thawed out and reanimated? Would that be me?” Yes, it would (or so I think). | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | If post-thaw you is identical with pre­thaw you, that’s because the years of frozen stillness didn’t interrupt your existence. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | Your mental life was interrupted—but not your existence tout court. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | So a sentient creature is identical with its body. That is the main argument on behalf of the physicalistic theory of personal identity. And it’s a good one. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | Beliefs are not happenings. They are not, as philosophers say, “occurrent.” A searing pain is occurrent. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | One’s mind isn’t one’s stream of mentation; it is the structure that mediates this mentation. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | The right slogan is: “no thought-enabling structure, no mind.” | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | Dr. McMullen is making two distinct points: (i) things are more basic than events. Things happen to things. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | Just as you say, my position is that events are the ultimate constituents of the spatiotemporal world and, therefore, that: (i) Although there could be events in the absence of things, there couldn't be things in the absence of events. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | Thus, there could not possibly be a thing that existed for just one instant. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | objects are identical with causal series. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | The sequence consisting of those two events would necessarily occupy a time-interval that was greater than an instant. | Analysis vs. Ontogenesis
Kuczynski | unable to do what he wants; his being unable to do what he wants is a by-product of his loss of freedom. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | To be sure, his inability to do what he wants is itself a loss of freedom. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | being free consists primarily in being oneself, and secondarily in being able to do what one wants. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | Acts that are driven by one's Higher-order desires need not be free; for people can, and often do, warp their higher-order desires, so as to make them fit their first-order desires. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | We will find that truly free acts are those that are driven, not by higher-order desires, but by values. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | And this is obviously close to what Frankfurt is saying, if it doesn't coincide with it. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | Here's an outline of what we'll find. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | We will find that there is no agency of any kind where there are no selves, and we will find that, where there are no values, there are no selves, though there may be minds. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | To be free, we have argued, one must identify with one’s desires—gratifying them isn’t enough. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | he acute schizophrenic who sees goblins dancing on his bed thinks that he’s seeing things as they are. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | Their symptoms belong to their minds but not to them; they are like alien-invaders that have taken root in their psyches. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | Supposing that you knuckle under to your ego-dystonic desire to become an accountant, you are acting freely in the sense that you are doing what you want to do, and you are acting unfreely in the sense that you are not doing what you want to want to do. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | But your agency is not intact. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | Every case of repression1 does, as CCR says, involve intrapsychic conflict. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | The real agents. The behaviors in which the organism engages are compulsive responses to instinct. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | A person who never repressed2 anything would quickly go mad. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | Repression2 isn’t always a bad thing. In many contexts, it’s the optimal thing. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | People value activities (e.g., helping somebody in need) that they don’t enjoy and enjoy activities (e.g., doing cocaine) that they don’t value. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | But those eccentricities associated with ego-dystonic ailments are often conflated with madness, leading to the false view that insanity is associated in some way with genius. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | The customary conception is given by assertion that the person in question has some propositional attitude P such that he knowingly chooses to cease to be aware of it. | When to Ontologize: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives
Kuczynski | Actual psychopaths tend to have some values. They like to tinker with cars, to build model airplanes, or whatnot. | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
Kuczynski | But the minds of actual psychopaths differ surprisingly little from M. | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
Kuczynski | There is one respect in which actual psychopaths resemble M that deserves special mention: like M, they have an extremely flexible relationship to the truth. | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
Kuczynski | So the psychopath doesn't have to lie. For the psychopath, some beliefs are more useful than others; so, for him, there is operational truth and falsehood. | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
Kuczynski | The highly conditional nature of their commitment to the truth forces them to make decisions on the basis of an unduly constricted body of knowledge, the results being that they are likely to commit horrible gaffes that alienate them from institutions within which one has to operate to succeed. | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
Kuczynski | But psychopaths are like a house of cards. | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
Kuczynski | They exude an unabashed self-confidence and authoritativeness. | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
Kuczynski | In any case, psychopaths are not at all like Hannibal Lecter. Psychopaths are frauds. They can’t accomplish anything without cheating. | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
Kuczynski | The psychopath has minds, but they don’t have selves. | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
Kuczynski | Since the psychopath has no values, his current experiences, etc. are not thus informed; he lives in the moment, in a pseudo-Zen manner. | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
Kuczynski | So in saying that, once one knows how a word is used, one ipso facto knows everything there is to know about its meaning, Wittgenstein was, I suspect, trying to convince himself that, falsely, that he did grasp the meanings of moral terms, given that he knew how they were used | Brentano and Meinong: Non-Analytic Methods
