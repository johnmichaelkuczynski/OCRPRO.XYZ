KUCZYNSKI | Reference is a property of expression-tokens, not expression-types. No expression-type refers to anything. Only tokens refer. | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | Meaning (sense) is a property of expression-types (platonic entities); reference is a property of expression-tokens (spatio-temporal entities). No entity has both meaning and reference in the same sense. | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | The meaning of an indexical sentence-type (e.g., 'I am tired') is a function from contexts of utterance to propositions. The meaning of such a token is a proposition. | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | All or nearly all sentences of natural language are indexical because they contain tense-markers. Therefore, virtually all sentence-types have functions (not propositions) for their meanings. | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | The distinction between 'sentences₁' (expressions with functions from contexts to propositions as meanings) and 'sentences₂' (expressions with propositions as meanings) would introduce a massive, implausible cleavage into a unified class. It is better to treat all sentences uniformly as having two-dimensional structure. | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | Sentence-types do not refer to anything. They no more refer than the type 'you' refers. | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | Sentence-tokens do not refer to truth-values. One can understand a sentence-token without knowing its truth-value, but one cannot understand a referring term without knowing what it refers to (at the token level). | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | Sentence-tokens refer to their meanings. Very roughly, the meaning of a sentence-token is a proposition; more precisely, it is a certain kind of function involving a proposition. | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | Forceless sentence-tokens (those embedded in larger sentences without independent assertoric, interrogative, or imperative force) refer to propositions. For example, in 'Necessarily, Mozart wrote music,' the embedded 'Mozart wrote music' denotes the proposition that Mozart wrote music. | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | Forced sentence-tokens (those with assertoric, interrogative, or imperative force) refer to functions involving propositions, not to bare propositions. The semantic content of a forced sentence-token is a function that assigns the property of success to that token exactly if the relevant proposition is true. | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | The semantic content of an indicative sentence-token must be something that an expression cannot have without having assertoric force. This requires a certain kind of innocuous circularity in the analysis. | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | Every indicative sentence-token (e.g., 'Plato snores') is semantically equivalent to 'A(that Plato snores)' where 'A' is an assertoric force-operator that assigns | Foundational Semantic Positions
KUCZYNSKI | Force is never generated by manipulating propositional content. Replacing one proposition-denoting expression with another cannot create or change force. | The Slingshot and Its Refutation
KUCZYNSKI | Force-operators are not merely conventionalized expressions of propositional attitudes. Saying "I believe that Plato snores" expresses belief but is semantically entirely different from asserting "Plato snores." | The Slingshot and Its Refutation
KUCZYNSKI | The assertoric force-operator denotes a function that assigns the property of success to a specific token exactly if a certain proposition is true. This self-referential structure is essential and non-viciously circular. | The Slingshot and Its Refutation
KUCZYNSKI | Let t be an arbitrary sentence-token. t encodes some proposition P, but that is not all t encodes. The semantic content of t as a whole is a function F that assigns the property of success to t exactly if P is true. | The Slingshot and Its Refutation
KUCZYNSKI | The semantic content of the corresponding type T is a function that assigns F to t. | The Slingshot and Its Refutation
KUCZYNSKI | This circularity is not vicious. The sentence-token t is a mere physical entity identifiable without mentioning any function. | The Slingshot and Its Refutation
KUCZYNSKI | For any proposition P, there exists a function F that assigns success to t exactly if P is true. We are simply identifying the semantic content of t with one of those functions. | The Slingshot and Its Refutation
KUCZYNSKI | If the semantic content of t does not mention t, then it would be possible for an expression to have that very content without having assertoric force. Self-reference is required for adequate semantics of force. | The Slingshot and Its Refutation
KUCZYNSKI | The Slingshot argument "proves" absurdities (e.g., that your car is identical with my computer). Therefore, it contains errors that must be exposed. | The Slingshot and Its Refutation
KUCZYNSKI | The Slingshot assumes (SS): Replacing a referring term with a co-referring term can result in a change of meaning. This principle is false. If "the author of Waverly" and "Scott" co-refer, then replacing one with the other should not change meaning. | The Slingshot and Its Refutation
KUCZYNSKI | Intersubstituting co-referring terms preserves reference. But if (SS) is true, then (CR) is false, since replacing co-referring terms can change meaning in non-extensional contexts. | Unified Semantics for Noun-Phrases
KUCZYNSKI | If E is an expression that rigidly designates a proposition or concept, and e is a referring term occurring as a proper part of E, then replacing e with a co-referring term may result in an expression with a different referent. | Unified Semantics for Noun-Phrases
KUCZYNSKI | The Slingshot assumes that sentences do not rigidly denote propositions, but this cannot be assumed in the relevant argumentative context. | Unified Semantics for Noun-Phrases
KUCZYNSKI | Many Slingshots make spurious use of (LL): logically equivalent sentences co-refer. But "1+1=2" and "triangles have three sides" don't say the same thing—one is about triangles, the other is not. | Unified Semantics for Noun-Phrases
KUCZYNSKI | The kind of "logical equivalence" between P and "the x such that x=1 and P" is entirely different from the logical equivalence between "1+1=2" and "triangles have three sides." Without recognizing this, many Slingshots fail. | Unified Semantics for Noun-Phrases
KUCZYNSKI | All noun-phrases—"Plato," "some man," "every bird," "the teacher"—should denote the same basic kind of entity to respect the grammatical unity of the category. | Unified Semantics for Noun-Phrases
KUCZYNSKI | A token of "Plato" denotes a function that assigns truth to a class C exactly if Plato is a member of C. This makes tokens of "Plato" fall into the same semantic category as tokens of quantifiers. | Unified Semantics for Noun-Phrases
KUCZYNSKI | A token of "some" denotes a function F that assigns truth to a class C exactly if C is instantiated (non-empty). | Unified Semantics for Noun-Phrases
KUCZYNSKI | A token of "every" denotes a function F that assigns truth to a class C exactly if C is universally instantiated. | Unified Semantics for Noun-Phrases
KUCZYNSKI | Tokens of proper names are directly referential by way of encoding functions that assign truth to classes based on whether the named individual is a member. | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | The character of "I am tired" is not a function from contexts to propositions but a function that assigns meaning to its tokens. | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | Propositions have decompositional structure. A proposition is not specified merely by its truth-conditions; its decomposition must also be given. | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | The Lewisian analysis (propositions as properties of worlds/sets of worlds) cannot accommodate the internal or decompositional differences between analytically equivalent propositions. | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | If propositions were merely properties of worlds, analytic propositions would "disappear"—they would tell us nothing since all worlds have them. | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | The naïve view that "Smith punches Jones" has three constituents (Smith, Jones, the relation of punching) overlooks additional structure. | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | Frege correctly saw that the proposition "Smith punches Jones" is built out of the relation "x punches y" and the functions "x punches Jones" and "Smith punches x." | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | A proposition is identical with a set S of properties, and for that proposition to be true is for all members of S to be instantiated. | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | For the proposition "Smith punches Jones" (Ap), the relevant set S contains exactly these properties: - Ps: the property of being identical with Smith - Pj: the property of being identical with Jones - Psx: the property of being a thing x such that Smith punches x - Pxj: the property of being a thing x such that x punches Jones - Pp: the relation of punching - P: the property of being a world where Smith punches Jones is true | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | (Ap) is true exactly if all six properties are instantiated. If any one is not instantiated, (Ap) is not true. | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | The instantiation of these properties is both necessary and sufficient for (Ap)'s truth. There is a one-to-one correspondence between discrete constituents of (Ap) and members of S. | Truth as Instantiatedness and the Unity of the Proposition
KUCZYNSKI | Different propositions can share constituents on this analysis. "Smith punches Jones" and "Plato punches Jones" share Pj, Pxj, and Pp, corresponding to the pre-theoretic intuition that they share constituents (Jones, the property of punching Jones, the relation of punching). | Meaning vs. Cognitive Content
KUCZYNSKI | A contingent proposition is never just true—it is true in virtue of some fact about the basic constituents of the world. Mass-energy is distributed a certain way; the "quantum is rippled" appropriately. | Meaning vs. Cognitive Content
KUCZYNSKI | The truth of "Plato punched Socrates" supervenes on facts about atomic movements, electron jumps, and mass-energy displacements. These facts are more basic than the proposition and can be described without mentioning Plato, Socrates, or punching. | Meaning vs. Cognitive Content
KUCZYNSKI | There is no circularity in analyzing a proposition in terms of the property a world has if that proposition is true, because the property (the "rippling") is more basic than the proposition. | Meaning vs. Cognitive Content
KUCZYNSKI | The storm of mass-energy displacements that realizes an event does not have the structure of the propositions describing it. Jones in the proposition is discrete from his attributes; Jones in reality is inseparable from the states of affairs on which his existence supervenes. | Meaning vs. Cognitive Content
KUCZYNSKI | The proposition "nothing snores" (ns) is identical with a set containing: - The property of being identical with the property "x snores" (the propositional form) - The property UT (universal falsity—every instance of the form is false) - The property P (the way the quantum is rippled in a world where nothing snores) | Meaning vs. Cognitive Content
KUCZYNSKI | The proposition "everything snores" (es) is identical with a set containing: - The property of being identical with the property "x snores" - The property UT (universal truth—every instance of the form is true) - The property P (the appropriate quantum rippling) | Meaning vs. Cognitive Content
KUCZYNSKI | The proposition "something snores" (ss) is identical with a set containing: - The property of being identical with the property of snoring - The property PT (being instantiated) - The property s* (the quantum rippling for a world where something snores) | Meaning vs. Cognitive Content
KUCZYNSKI | Quantified propositions are meta-propositional—they concern classes of propositions. "Something snores" says at least one | Meaning vs. Cognitive Content
KUCZYNSKI | Grammatical inflections do not themselves refer to anything but assign referents to sequences of expressions on the basis of the referents of the components. | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | The difference between a sentence-token and an unmeaning heap lies in facts about grammar. | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | Word-order in English does exactly what is done in Latin or Russian by case-endings. It is a grammatical device par excellence. | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | Grammatical inflections determine what will be the constituents of the propositions meant by sentence-tokens. | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | Denotes₁: E denotes₁ O exactly if, in virtue of having the form "…E…," a sentence-token encodes a proposition P such that P's being true involves a state of affairs having O as a constituent. | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | Denotes₂: E denotes₂ O exactly if, in virtue of having the form "…E…," a sentence-token encodes a proposition P such that O is a member of the set with which P is identical. | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | Particulars like Smith are not separable, isolable constituents of the universe. | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | Individuals are properties of states of affairs. | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | What we call "properties" (redness, roundness) are really properties of properties of properties—third-order properties. | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | Literal meaning (semantic encoding) must be distinguished from communicated meaning (cognitive significance). | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | Rationality is measured in terms of communicated meaning, not literal meaning. | Critique of Externalism
KUCZYNSKI | 'Hesperus' names the last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky' is really to say 'Something x is uniquely a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky and 'Hesperus' names x.' | Necessity A Posteriori
KUCZYNSKI | All perception is existential/predicational. When you see an object, the content of your perception is given by an existence claim: 'there is an object x such that x has shape [...] and luminosity [...] and...' | Necessity A Posteriori
KUCZYNSKI | The cognitive significance of 'Hesperus is lovely' (for someone taught via ostension) is an existence claim: 'There is an object x such that x is alone in the morning sky, has [...] shape, [...] luminosity, and 'Hesperus' names x, and x is lovely.' | Necessity A Posteriori
KUCZYNSKI | 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' are synonymous (both are mere labels for Venus), but sentences containing them can have different cognitive significance because the existence claims through which their meanings are communicated differ. | Necessity A Posteriori
KUCZYNSKI | The proposition literally encoded in a sentence is object-involving, but the cognitive significance may not be. The planet Hesperus is 'existentialized out' of what is cognitively grasped. | Necessity A Posteriori
KUCZYNSKI | Semantic externalism (about literal meaning) is true; content externalism (about mental content) is false. | Necessity A Posteriori
KUCZYNSKI | Semantic externalism: The literal meaning of 'water quenches thirst' differs in world w (where water is H₂O) and world w* (where 'water' refers to XYZ). Literal meaning does not supervene on what is 'in people's heads.' | Necessity A Posteriori
KUCZYNSKI | Content externalism (rejected): The view that two subjects who are intrinsically identical (leaving aside distal causes) can have different mental contents simply because the distal causes of their states differ. | Necessity A Posteriori
KUCZYNSKI | The information Jones-in-w associates with 'water quenches thirst' is identical to what Jones-in-w* associates with it. Both grasp the same existence claim. What differs is the truth-maker, not the truth-condition | Necessity A Posteriori
KUCZYNSKI | Truth-makers can vary while truth-conditions remain constant. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | Externalism creates a dilemma about self-knowledge. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | If Hesperus-thoughts require a causal connection to Hesperus, and if I can know with incorrigible certainty that I am thinking about Hesperus, then I would have incorrigible proof of the external world—which is absurd. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | When Smith says "I know with incorrigible certainty that I am thinking that Hesperus is lovely," the de dicto (wide-scope) reading is what he grasps: he knows incorrigibly that he is thinking an existence claim. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | Whatever is going on in one's Cartesian theatre does not logically necessitate the existence of any external object. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | Conception is never constituted by a causal connection between subject and object. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | A causal connection may be mentioned in the identifying description, but it is never constitutive of the concept itself. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | Causal relations are not fine-grained enough for reference. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | Any causal relation I have to the clay is also a causal relation to the statue, but I can refer to one without referring to the other. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | The causal theory does not apply to expressions with constituent structure. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | My concept of "brown angry cow" is not a causal connection to brown angry cows. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | Fodor's extreme causal theory of concepts (CCC) fails. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | If some concepts are causal connections while others (complex concepts) are not, the concept of "concept" becomes implausibly disjunctive. | Empty and Fictitious Names
KUCZYNSKI | Some thoughts clearly have their representational contents essentially (e.g., the thought that 2+2=4). It is arbitrary to say some thoughts have this property while others (externally individuated thoughts) do not. | Indexicals, Anaphora, and Definite Descriptions
KUCZYNSKI | Externalist mental content appears causally inert. What does causal work is the local, intrinsic brain state shared by Smith and Twin-Smith. The difference in distal cause (Mary vs. Twin-Mary) makes no causal difference to behavior. | Indexicals, Anaphora, and Definite Descriptions
KUCZYNSKI | Jackson and Pettit's attempt to save externalism via "program causes" fails. The distinction between causal efficacy and causal relevance does not rescue the causal potency of externally individuated content. | Indexicals, Anaphora, and Definite Descriptions
KUCZYNSKI | The proposition literally encoded in "Hesperus is Phosphorus" is analytic: it is "Hesperus is Hesperus" (= Venus is Venus), which is trivially necessary. | Indexicals, Anaphora, and Definite Descriptions
KUCZYNSKI | What is a posteriori is not the proposition encoded but the empirical work needed to discover that "Hesperus" and "Phosphorus" co-refer. The cognitive significance involves existence claims that are contingent. | Indexicals, Anaphora, and Definite Descriptions
KUCZYNSKI | "Hesperus might not have been Phosphorus" is, strictly speaking, absurd. A thing cannot be other than itself. What is not absurd is a claim about our epistemic situation: the perceptions associated with "Hesperus" and "Phosphorus" could have been caused by two distinct objects. | Indexicals, Anaphora, and Definite Descriptions
KUCZYNSKI | When we say S expresses a "necessary a posteriori" truth, we really mean: the literal meaning of S is analytic, but empirical work is needed to figure out that fact. | Indexicals, Anaphora, and Definite Descriptions
KUCZYNSKI | The wide-scope/narrow-scope distinction explains the appearance of "necessary a posteriori." Giving the necessity operator narrowest scope yields analytic truths; widest scope yields contingent falsehoods. | Indexicals, Anaphora, and Definite Descriptions
KUCZYNSKI | Empty non-fictitious names (like "Vulcan") were supposed to refer but don't. The cognitive significance of "Vulcan is a planet" is still an existence claim, explaining why such sentences are cognitively meaningful. | Indexicals, Anaphora, and Definite Descriptions
KUCZYNSKI | Fictitious names (like "Sherlock Holmes") are not even supposed to refer—they are supposed to be supposed to refer. Every story operates under an implicit "suppose that" operator. | Indexicals, Anaphora, and Definite Descriptions
KUCZYNSKI | There is no need to posit the actual existence of fictional objects. | Quine on Intensional Verbs (Corrected)
KUCZYNSKI | Mythical objects (Zeus, Hera) are not fictitious—they were posits of erroneous beliefs, like Vulcan and phlogiston. | Quine on Intensional Verbs (Corrected)
KUCZYNSKI | "he" is not ambiguous between its demonstrative and anaphoric uses—the anaphoric "he" is a quotation within the semantic rule. | The Frege-Russell Semantic Rule for Quantifiers (Vindicated)
KUCZYNSKI | Definite descriptions behave exactly like indexicals: tokens of "the phi" refer to the contextually salient instance of the sortal phi. | The Frege-Russell Semantic Rule for Quantifiers (Vindicated)
KUCZYNSKI | Even mathematical descriptions like "the sum of two and three" are context-sensitive in principle. Since only one entity can instantiate that sortal, it is by default always the salient instance. | The Frege-Russell Semantic Rule for Quantifiers (Vindicated)
