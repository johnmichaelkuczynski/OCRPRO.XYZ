kuczynski | Statements are true that self-verify | Logic
kuczynski | Nothing doesn't follow from a contradiction | Logic
kuczynski | Nothing doesn't entail a tautology | Logic
kuczynski | No contradiction follows from a truth | Logic
kuczynski | No falsehood follows from a tautology | Logic
kuczynski | A truth is necessary if it follows from any given statement-set | Logic
kuczynski | A truth is necessary if its negation entails a contradiction | Logic
kuczynski | A truth is possible if it does not entail a contradiction | Logic
kuczynski | A truth is possible if its negation is not necessary | Logic
kuczynski | Statements about number are encrypted statements about order | Mathematics
kuczynski | Mathematics is the study of ordinal relations | Mathematics
kuczynski | Any given truth concerning ordinal relations is equivalent with a truth of set-theory | Mathematics
kuczynski | An algorithm is simply a useful recursion | Mathematics
kuczynski | Whenever somebody articulates a thought, he does by computing the identity of the appropriate expression; and whenever somebody understands the words of another, he does so by computing its meaning | Language
kuczynski | Any two classes that can be recursively defined have the same cardinality | Mathematics
kuczynski | Given any top-down list of elements of ℝ, expressed as nonterminating decimals, there is a number, namely D(L) (read: the diagonal of L), that is not in L | Mathematics
kuczynski | Diagonal arguments are always used to prove incompleteness | Mathematics
kuczynski | If it can be proved that, for any given model M of a given axiom-set, there is a model M* of that same axiom-set that is non-isomorphic with M*, then that axiom-set is incomplete | Mathematics
kuczynski | Model-theory is the branch of mathematics that studies classes of sentence-schemata | Mathematics
kuczynski | There are many reasons why no scientific discipline can be formalized | Philosophy of Science
kuczynski | There is nothing that either ℚ or ℤ enables us to say about the world that ℕ doesn't allow us to say. The discovery of ℚ-arithmetic and ℤ-arithmetic were ultimately more notational than mathematical | Mathematics
kuczynski | But the discovery of ℝ-arithmetic was a genuine intellectual advance | Mathematics
kuczynski | Even though ℝ is built out of the same ingredients as ℚ and ℤ and therefore ℕ itself, the way in which those ingredients are arranged in ℝ differs fundamentally from the way in which they are arranged in any given one of the other three classes | Mathematics
kuczynski | Cantor's system is not really about number at all. It is an analysis of recursivity and its limits—that is to say, of completeness and incompleteness | Mathematics
kuczynski | An incompleteness proof is simply a proof that, for some class C, there is no recursive definition of C | Mathematics
kuczynski | The non-recursivity of ℝ is really a consequence of the fact that [PK]>[K] | Mathematics
kuczynski | The non-recursivity of ℝ is a consequence of the fact that there is no recursive definition of the class of all logically true statements | Mathematics
kuczynski | Kurt Gödel's celebrated (1931) incompleteness proof is to the effect that the class of all arithmetical truths is incomplete | Mathematics
kuczynski | Gödel's theorem is really a special case of a more comprehensive principle, namely, that the class of recursive definitions is not itself recursively defined | Mathematics
kuczynski | In other words, there is no formal procedure by which, when given an arbitrary statement S, to determine whether or not S is a truth of logic | Logic
kuczynski | P strictly entails Q if Q is a logical consequence of P. Q is a logical consequence of P if there is no possible world where P is true and Q is false | Logic
kuczynski | A language is a recursively defined class of sentences | Language
kuczynski | A 'language' that contains only finitely many expressions is but a caricature of a bona fide language | Language
kuczynski | That said, there is one intrinsic difference between formal (artificial) and natural languages, namely, that any given natural language is really hierarchy of languages | Language
kuczynski | The concept of formal truth is a relative notion | Logic
kuczynski | Therefore, there is no recursive definition of the class of logical truths | Logic
kuczynski | Mathematics is the study of structure. Statements about order can always be expressed as statements about relations holding among numbers or sets thereof | Mathematics
kuczynski | But mathematics is interested in number only because truths about number are encrypted truths about structure | Mathematics
kuczynski | Laws of nature are invariances. Laws of nature are framework-invariant relations between objects | Philosophy of Science
kuczynski | Geometry is not interested in this or that circle or square... geometry is interested in properties of shapes that are transformation-invariant | Mathematics
kuczynski | Formal logic is really the geometry of strings of symbols. It has nothing to do with rules of inference | Logic
kuczynski | Syntax is symbol-geometry. Semantics is symbol-meaning. Formal logic is syntax, not semantics. Informal logic is semantics, not syntax | Logic
kuczynski | Meaning is a relation between statement and non-statement; truth is a property of meaning. Therefore, the concepts of meaning and truth have no place in the discipline of formal logic | Logic
kuczynski | Thus, to the extent that logic is concerned with meaning and truth, it is incapable of being formalized; and to the extent that logic is capable of being formalized, it doesn't concern meaning or truth | Logic
kuczynski | Mathematics is the discipline that identifies structural invariants | Mathematics
kuczynski | According to the Platonist view, numbers and other mathematical entities are non-spatiotemporal; their existence is no more mind-dependent than that of a rock or a tree, but, unlike rocks and trees, those entities are not in space or time | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | The formalist holds that Mathematics holds among meaningless expressions of arbitrary symbolic calculi and For that reason mathematical realities have no existence outside of the calculi that we happen to create | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | It is therefore quite as misconceived to say that '35,247×254=8,952,738' is true by convention as it is to say that 'snow is white' is true by convention | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Logical consequences of conventions are non-conventions that have a conventional basis | Logic
kuczynski | If formalism is correct, then mathematics is the study of uninterpreted formal calculi | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Mathematics is the study of uninterpreted formal calculi. And given any one such calculus, the rules assigning meaning to its primitive expressions (the axioms of that calculus, in other words) are indeed conventions and, therefore, tautologously true. But there is nothing conventional about the relationship between the axioms of a formal calculus and the consequences of those axioms: those relations are of a non-conventional, strictly logical nature | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | A set of meaning-postulates models a given uninterpreted calculus just in case, if it is supposed that the expressions of that calculus have the meanings in question, the resulting interpreted calculus is consistent | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | When an interpretation adequately models a formal calculus, the result is a scientific discipline that describes the universe (or some sector thereof) | Philosophy of Science
kuczynski | Whenever it is assumed that logical/mathematical laws are creations of ours, the relations among those creations end up having all of the properties that numbers/mathematical entities per se are supposed to have | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Unless our inborn psychological structure shadowed mind-independent facts, it wouldn't be able to organize the effects that such facts had on us | Epistemology
kuczynski | If arithmetical truths registered empirical facts, we'd have to adjust the laws of arithmetic with every such advance in our empirical knowledge. But we don't. The arithmetical norms remains | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Physical truths cannot be read off of strictly mathematical truths | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Mathematics turns out to be a kind of linguistics; and poets (and philosophers) turn out to be mathematicians, albeit ones whose data-sets, unlike those of physicists, are not best organized by calculi that are capable of numerical interpretations | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Mathematical truths are not given by theorems or even by metatheorems; for, as these examples show, theorems and metatheorems are calculus internal | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Substantive mathematical truths are given by metan-theorems, where a meta1-theorem is a meta-theorem and metan+1-theorem is a meta-metatheorem | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Mathematicians—and, I would contend, all thinkers of all kinds—are interested, ultimately, only those statement-sets that either have empirical interpretations or in terms of which those that do have such interpretations are to be understood | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Without raw data, it isn't possible to identify prediction- and explanation-generative formal calculi; without formal calculi, it is not possible to convert raw data into predictions and explanations | Philosophy of Science
kuczynski | The spuriousness of the distinction between mathematical and non-mathematical laws... it isn't laws that are mathematical; it is descriptions of laws | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | The reason that physics can be mapped onto calculus is that calculus was invented to describe physical laws. The reason that banking can be mapped onto arithmetic is that arithmetic was invented to accommodate the needs of bankers | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | The truths of the differential calculus are non-empirical but empirically motivated, the same being true of the truths of arithmetic, analytic geometry, and every other branch of mathematics | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | A failure to understand the distinction between empirical and empirically motivated has led to disastrously wrong theories, e.g. Mill's empiricism and Hilbert's formalism, concerning the nature of mathematics | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | When a formalism is invented, so as to provide a systematic way of interpreting empirical data, that formalism is almost always capable of multiple interpretations | Philosophy of Science
kuczynski | He would rather work with a formalism that has a great deal of scope, but always yields low-resolution truths, than one that has minimal scope, but always yields high resolution truths | Philosophy of Science
kuczynski | Platonism is the doctrine that spatiotemporal entities are 'instances' of—meaning only that they are to be understood in terms of—nonspatiotemporal entities. This doctrine is correct | Metaphysics
kuczynski | The spatiotemporal world is to be understood in terms of relations holding among its constituents and, therefore, in terms of relations holding among the space-time regions occupied by its constituents | Metaphysics
kuczynski | Truths about structure cannot themselves always be structural truths | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Mathematics aspires to identify, not this or that specific formal truth, but entire classes of formal truths. The propositions that identify such classes are not themselves formal truths | Philosophy of Mathematics
kuczynski | Truths about linguistic conventions are not themselves linguistic conventions | Philosophy of Language
kuczynski | Thus, truths about formal truths are not themselves formal truths, and truths about conventions are not themselves conventions | Logic
kuczynski | Necessary consequences of tautologies are not themselves tautologies | Logic
kuczynski | The real laws of logic are meta-laws: laws about laws; laws that transform law-sets into different but equally powerful law-sets | Logic
kuczynski | No viable logic has but one primitive category: there must be at least two. And however many primitive categories there are, they must be mutually exclusive: otherwise they aren't primitive | Logic
kuczynski | For x to have a certain mass/length/temperature is for x to have certain causal properties | Metaphysics
kuczynski | Seemingly synchronic forms of measurement, e.g. the juxtaposition method of length-determination, collapse into their obviously diachronic counterparts | Philosophy of Science
kuczynski | A static property, e.g. length, is a four-dimensional property. A dynamic property, e.g. velocity, is a change in a static property | Metaphysics
kuczynski | The arbitrariness of the metrical unit What one regards as a unit of length (or time or mass) is obviously arbitrary. In fact, it is inherent in the nature of measurement that one's choice of metrical unit be arbitrary | Philosophy of Science
kuczynski | Never a priori the case that the reals yielded by measurement correspond to the cardinals yielded by enumeration | Philosophy of Science
kuczynski | Large distances are non-integrable. They cannot be determined by adding together small distances | Philosophy of Science
kuczynski | Wherever complexity is involved, quantitative differences involve qualitative differences | Metaphysics
kuczynski | No consistent language has the resources to adequately describe its own resources | Language
kuczynski | The more systematic a language is, the more precise are the statements belonging to it | Language
kuczynski | The more productive a language is, the greater scope it has | Language
kuczynski | A language must therefore be able to 'turn over', like an engine, an indefinitely large number of times | Language
