kuczynski | Content-externalism is the doctrine that what a person is thinking is constitutively dependent on facts about his environment | Content Externalism
kuczynski | Two brain-states can be qualitatively identical, leaving aside facts about their causal origins, and yet have different contents | Content Externalism
kuczynski | Content-externalism and semantic-externalism are distinct doctrines: the first is about what people think, the second is about what our words mean | Content vs Semantic Externalism
kuczynski | A failure to distinguish between content-externalism and semantic-externalism has led to much confusion in contemporary thought | Content vs Semantic Externalism
kuczynski | Semantic-externalism is unqualifiedly true, even though content-externalism is unqualifiedly false | Content vs Semantic Externalism
kuczynski | So long as we confine ourselves to the regions occupied by their bodies, there is nothing that distinguishes Max from Twin-Max, making them physically and psychologically identical | Content Externalism
kuczynski | To the extent that mental content must be understood along content-externalist lines, it is without any psychological significance | Content Externalism
kuczynski | Genuine differences destroy parallelism and disrupt relational facts, but the supposed differences between Max and Twin-Max are completely non-disruptive | Content Externalism
kuczynski | The differences between Max and Twin-Max are like those between the worlds in Poincare's thought-experiment regarding absolute size | Content Externalism
kuczynski | The primary purpose of language is to convey what is relevant, where relevance is to be understood in pragmatic, not philosophical, terms | Language and Meaning
kuczynski | Given the practical nature of language, there is no reason to expect that our locutions will always reproduce the delicate distinctions needed for solutions to recherché questions of logic and epistemology | Language and Meaning
kuczynski | Kripke made a strong case that proper names are not synonymous with any definite description and are directly referential | Reference and Naming
kuczynski | One can think about Socrates without knowing of any description that singles him out | Conception and Reference
kuczynski | A referring term refers to its object because a certain kind of causal relation holds between tokens of that term and that object | Causal Theory of Reference
kuczynski | The causal story is only a chapter in the descriptive story, not the whole narrative of reference | Causal Theory of Reference
kuczynski | Even though one learns what a name refers to through descriptive or ostensive means, the name itself remains a mere label | Reference and Naming
kuczynski | What your visual experience, taken by itself, tells you is going to be a function solely of facts about the physical properties of the situation right in front of you | Perception and Content
kuczynski | Your visual experience, by itself, cannot possibly register the fact that it is x3, as opposed to x24, that you are seeing | Perception and Content
kuczynski | Mary is no more a part of your visual experience than Twin-Mary or any other Mary-impostor | Perception and Content
kuczynski | Content-externalism cannot accommodate the obvious fact that perceptions with different objects can have a great deal of representational content in common | Content Externalism
kuczynski | Numerically different objects, qualitatively different contents—this is the essence of the content-externalist's view | Content Externalism
kuczynski | What the content-externalist calls identity-dependent content is actually not content but meta-content | Content vs Meta-content
kuczynski | Sentence-tokens, not sentence-types, bear propositions | Semantics
kuczynski | The semantic content of a sentence-type is a rule that assigns a proposition to any given token of that type | Semantics
kuczynski | Two tokens that have the very same propositions for their literal meanings may communicate very different propositions | Semantics and Communication
kuczynski | Many apparent substitution-failures involve no change in literal meaning and are to be understood pragmatically in terms of pre-semantics | Substitutivity and Meaning
kuczynski | Russell's Theory of Descriptions, though ingenious, has non-trivial problems that our theory does not share | Theory of Descriptions
kuczynski | Frege's view that definite descriptions refer to their senses in propositional attitude contexts is deeply implausible and ad hoc | Frege and Reference
kuczynski | There is no such thing as the sense of the sense of a sense, making Frege's hierarchy untenable | Frege's Senses
kuczynski | Proper names are rigid designators: given the semantics of English, it is fixed what those expressions refer to | Rigid Designation
kuczynski | When identity holds, it holds necessarily—nothing could possibly fail to be itself | Necessity of Identity
kuczynski | There are necessary a posteriori truths, showing that not all necessity is analytic or a priori | A Posteriori Necessity
kuczynski | The argument for a posteriori necessity involves a major non-sequitur when it confuses literal meaning with communicated meaning | A Posteriori Necessity
kuczynski | What is communicated by a sentence-token is a function not merely of its literal meaning, but of the information through which one ascertains its literal meaning | Meaning and Communication
kuczynski | We access the meaning of tokens through existence claims, which is why tokens communicate more than their bare literal content | Meaning and Communication
kuczynski | Having discriminating knowledge of an object is different from knowing that object's identity | Conception vs Identification
kuczynski | Being able to have thoughts about x is different from knowing who or what x is | Conception vs Identification
kuczynski | The discriminative knowledge needed to grasp singular propositions is prior to a knowledge of the object's identity | Conception and Knowledge
kuczynski | The concept of knowing-who is contextual—the sentence can be true in one context and false in another | Knowing-Who
kuczynski | Evans is right that demonstrative identification requires uniquely discriminating knowledge, but wrong that this knowledge is not descriptive | Evans and Conception
kuczynski | Demonstrative thoughts are not Russellian even though demonstrative utterances are | Demonstratives
kuczynski | There is no thought that you are having in the hallucinatory scenario that you are not also having in the veridical one | Mental Content
kuczynski | If content-externalism is right, then for some x, your knowledge that you are thinking about x is no more certain than your knowledge about remote regions of the cosmos | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | Content-externalism has the counter-intuitive consequence that you don't know the identities of your conscious thoughts with any more certainty than you know about the external world | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | If you are consciously thinking a thought, you do know with a special certainty that you are thinking that thought | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | Burge's argument that self-fulfilling thoughts guarantee self-knowledge presupposes conditions that content-externalism cannot guarantee are met | Burge on Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | There are situations epistemically just like ours where, if externalism is right, we fail to have the thoughts we take ourselves to have | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | When we want to assess whether content-externalism is compatible with self-knowledge, we must consider all epistemically identical worlds | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | Content-externalism's problem is not just that it violates Cartesian certainty about having thoughts, but about which thoughts we are having | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | The causal efficacy of mental content cannot be established by tautologous consequences of our definitions | Mental Causation
kuczynski | If the content-externalist is right, X's being a constituent of mental content supervenes on processes that went out of existence before humans existed | Mental Causation
kuczynski | There is an important difference between X being a cause of thought and X's being a constituent of mental content being a cause of thought | Mental Causation
kuczynski | Jackson and Pettit were misled by failing to distinguish between logical and causal explanations | Program Causation
kuczynski | The connection content-externalism establishes between mental content and effects is logical, not causal | Mental Causation
kuczynski | Formal truth is semantic truth—there is no notion more semantic than formal truth | Formal Truth
kuczynski | A statement is formally true or formally false exactly if its truth-value can be computed on the basis of the rules that assign it meaning | Formal Truth
kuczynski | Unless a creature is responding to the semantic properties of symbols, it is not responding to forms in any relevant sense | CTM Critique
kuczynski | CTM involves a misunderstanding of the concept of syntactic form and a failure to register the ambiguity of the word form | CTM Critique
kuczynski | There is a mechanical procedure for deciding whether some sentences are true, but this mechanicality is semantic, not morphological | CTM Critique
kuczynski | A symbol-token has both morphological and socio-psychological components | Symbol Theory
kuczynski | The morphological component has done its job if it directs the auditor towards the right socio-psychological component | Symbol Theory
kuczynski | Whether a given sound betokens this or that symbol is a function not of its morphology alone but of the relation of morphology to context | Symbol Theory
kuczynski | Two morphologically identical sounds can betoken different words, and two morphologically very different sounds can betoken the same word | Symbol Theory
kuczynski | A symbol-type is a relation between morphology and context; a symbol-token is an instance of such a relation | Symbol Theory
kuczynski | Because symbols are relations between morphology and context, it is not coherent to speak of morphologically petrified languages | Symbol Theory
kuczynski | Symbolic manipulations can never track semantics in virtue of being morphology-driven | CTM Critique
kuczynski | Because symbols are relations between morphology and context, mere morphology-manipulation isn't symbol-manipulation | CTM Critique
kuczynski | CTM is no more consistent with the causal efficacy of the mental than content-externalism | CTM Critique
kuczynski | Fodor's view that thinking consists in manipulating shapes fails because expression-types are not shapes | CTM Critique
kuczynski | To compute is to manipulate symbol-tokens, but symbol-tokens are not instances of shapes | CTM Critique
kuczynski | If Mentalese symbols get their meaning from causal chains going back thousands of years, CTM becomes committed to the most aggressive form of content-externalism | CTM Critique
kuczynski | The distinction between reference-fixing and meaning-giving has far-reaching implications for scientific methodology | Reference and Meaning
kuczynski | An operational definition can fix the referent of a term without giving its meaning | Operational Definition
kuczynski | The term operationalism is ambiguous between the reference-fixing and meaning-giving senses of define | Operationalism
kuczynski | The hypothesis that someone is following a rule is confirmationally different from the hypothesis that they are merely acting in accordance with it | Rule-Following
kuczynski | If somebody grasps arithmetic, that knowledge will be expressed in ways other than manipulating the right symbols | Rule-Following
kuczynski | Calculators don't really add—their behavior is not like that of someone who truly grasps arithmetic | Rule-Following
kuczynski | Concepts and aptitudes are not frozen—if you grasp one concept, you necessarily grasp various others | Holism of Concepts
kuczynski | Calculators are not themselves performing arithmetical operations, but their behavior is still appropriately understood in terms of such operations | Calculators and Computation
kuczynski | A person can use a calculator to add numbers—the activities of calculators are constitutive of actual computation even though calculators do not themselves compute | Calculators and Computation
kuczynski | The fact that calculators act like something that computes corresponds to the fact that something really is computing—the human using the calculator | Calculators and Computation
kuczynski | A language is a set of semantic rules, and a set of semantic rules is not a set of platonic entities | Nature of Language
kuczynski | A set of semantic rules is constituted by psychological entities—understandings that hold among people | Nature of Language
kuczynski | The psychological states that immediately cause my utterances are not constituents of the English language | Language and Psychology
kuczynski | Language-use is causally responsible for language-change, but use is not constitutive of language-change | Language Change
kuczynski | Events are hyper-changes—changes in the manner in which things change | Metaphysics of Events
kuczynski | A language-change is not a structure-internal event but one that alters the relevant structure | Language Change
kuczynski | Lewis is right that a language is a set of semantic rules but wrong about what semantic rules are | Nature of Language
kuczynski | Langue and parole are both spatiotemporal entities—not all spatiotemporal entities are events | Saussure's Distinction
kuczynski | Propositions can be identified with sets of properties, and a proposition's being true with all its members being instantiated | Propositional Structure
kuczynski | The problem of the unity of the proposition can be solved by understanding propositions as structured sets of properties | Propositional Structure
kuczynski | The concept of propositional constituency is to be understood in terms of the concept of dependence | Propositional Structure
kuczynski | X is a constituent of proposition Y iff Y depends on X in a certain way | Propositional Structure
kuczynski | Thought is prior to language—linguistic meaning presupposes the existence of thought | Thought and Language
kuczynski | There is non-linguistic communication—infants and non-human animals can make themselves understood | Non-Linguistic Communication
kuczynski | For something to be a symbol of a public language, there must be success conditions associated with its use | Symbol and Success
kuczynski | The existence of thought is a prerequisite to that of anything resembling a symbol of a public language | Thought and Language
kuczynski | Logical form is very different from grammatical form—where natural languages are concerned, they pull apart | Logical vs Grammatical Form
kuczynski | There is no morphological characterization of syntax, no syntactic characterization of logic, no morphological characterization of logic | Form and Logic
kuczynski | A morphology-driven manipulation of symbols is not necessarily one that tracks either syntactic or logical form | Form and Logic
kuczynski | Where there are indexicals, there is necessarily a divergence between logical and syntactical form | Indexicals and Form
kuczynski | If our thoughts are mediated by some kind of language, the expressions of that language are replete with indexicals | Indexicals and Thought
kuczynski | Even granting all of CTM's assumptions, it fails to account for the fact that our cognitive activity embodies sensitivity to logical form | CTM Critique
kuczynski | We must distinguish between analytic truth and formal truth—not all analytic truths are formally true | Analytic vs Formal Truth
kuczynski | A sentence is logically true exactly if its truth is a theorem of the semantic rules of the language to which it belongs | Logical Truth
kuczynski | Any token of I am here now is logically true even though it encodes an a posteriori, contingent proposition | Logical Truth
kuczynski | Syntax is an aspect of meaning—a sentence-token's syntax lies in how it means what it means | Syntax and Semantics
kuczynski | Davidson's view that one must know a language to think is incompatible with the compositional nature of meaning | Davidson Critique
kuczynski | Linguistic competence can no more be explained without positing cognitive processes than Brownian motion can be explained without molecules | Chomsky's Argument
kuczynski | Speaker's meaning presupposes conventional meaning—I cannot mean P by noise N unless I believe N already means P | Speaker's Meaning
kuczynski | Knowledge of language facilitates thought but cannot be constitutive of the ability to think, since thinking is prerequisite to learning a language | Thought and Language
kuczynski | The photograph model of conception—that concepts relate to objects as photographic plates relate to causes—must be rejected | Conception
kuczynski | One's grasping any one concept involves grasping various others—conceptual atomism is false | Holism of Concepts
kuczynski | A concept of x cannot be realized wholly by a causal relation to x | Conception
kuczynski | Frege eloquently defended the point that there was something to be true or false prior to thought | Propositions and Thought
kuczynski | Pre-linguistic creatures can have true and false mental contents | Pre-Linguistic Thought
kuczynski | The process of learning what a name refers to—whether by description, ostension, or simply picking it up from context—still leaves the name as a mere label | Reference and Naming
kuczynski | The causal chain connecting our use of a name to its original bearer does not make the name synonymous with any description | Causal Theory of Reference
kuczynski | You never just see Smith—you see a thing embedded in a situation whose perceptual representation is replete with descriptive content | Perception and Description
kuczynski | Content-internalism holds that mental content is fixed by intrinsic properties of the thinker, independent of external relations | Content Internalism
kuczynski | Semantic externalism about linguistic meaning is compatible with internalism about mental content | Semantic Externalism
kuczynski | The information that enables you to associate a name with the right object has an existential form | Reference and Existence Claims
kuczynski | Recognition of identities like Hesperus equals Phosphorus involves the convergence of two knowledge-streams | Identity and Knowledge
kuczynski | The content of visual experience is existential in character—it cannot be given by a mere noun-phrase | Perception and Content
kuczynski | Perceptions make us aware of objects by apprising us of existence-claims that those objects satisfy | Perception and Knowledge
kuczynski | Disjunctivism—the view that perceptions of different objects share no content—is demonstrably false | Disjunctivism
kuczynski | Two perceptions can have dramatically different objects yet share a great deal of existential information | Perception and Content
kuczynski | The externalist's response that mental content encompasses remote regions of space has consequences too revisionist to accept | Content Externalism
kuczynski | You cannot just see Smith—you must see a thing embedded in a situation replete with descriptive content | Perception and Description
kuczynski | The content of perception, so far as it can be expressed in language, is given by a sentence, not a noun-phrase | Perception and Content
kuczynski | When you see a star that went out of existence millions of years ago, the externalist must say your perception lacks complete content—but your perception does have complete content | Content Externalism
kuczynski | The contextualist nature of the expression knowing-who explains apparent paradoxes about identity and knowledge | Knowing-Who
kuczynski | You can fail to know of your kindly neighbor that he is a crime lord only because you can already have thoughts about him | Conception vs Identification
kuczynski | Being able to think about x is different from knowing who or what x is, even allowing for the contextual nature of the latter | Conception vs Identification
kuczynski | Evans correctly distinguishes facts about our concepts from facts about what is represented within them | Evans on Conception
kuczynski | Not every fact about a concept is represented within that concept | Conception
kuczynski | Evans' argument against descriptivism fails because perceptions make us aware of objects through existence-claims | Evans Critique
kuczynski | If content-externalism is right, there is a kind of cognitive blank in the hallucinatory case where there would be a thought in the veridical case | Content Externalism
kuczynski | The same psychological properties can be had in situations where different thoughts are had, on the externalist view—but this seems wrong | Content Externalism
kuczynski | There is a certainty that can attach to knowledge of what we are consciously thinking that cannot attach to knowledge of the external world | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | Burge's argument about self-fulfilling thoughts establishes certainty only in worlds where we already have the relevant thoughts | Burge Critique
kuczynski | Your counterpart in a Descartes-free world is wrong to attribute thoughts about Descartes to himself | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | Burge's argument begs the question by restricting attention to worlds where the relevant object has been loaded into our thoughts | Burge Critique
kuczynski | Content-externalism makes it impossible to know with Cartesian certainty whether one is having a thought at all | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | The externalist's guarantee that mental content has effects is logical, not causal—a tautologous consequence of definitions | Mental Causation
kuczynski | When we assess causal potency, we don't want to study the logical consequences of our definitions | Mental Causation
kuczynski | There is no time at which X's being a constituent of Smith's mental content exists, given that X and Smith are separated by millions of years | Mental Causation
kuczynski | Not every non-empty noun-phrase denotes a state of affairs in the causal sense | Mental Causation
kuczynski | Somebody's coughing is not a state of affairs—you never just hear someone coughing, you hear some specific person doing so | States of Affairs
kuczynski | The flame is contemporaneous with events causally effective with respect to the heating—but the star ceased to exist millions of years ago | Mental Causation
kuczynski | Jackson and Pettit over-extend the term program-cause to denote two quite different concepts | Program Causation
kuczynski | CTM conflates different senses of form—morphological, syntactic, and semantic | CTM Critique
kuczynski | The ambiguity of form lies at the root of the appeal of CTM | CTM Critique
kuczynski | Symbol-tokens are instances of relations between morphology and context, not mere shapes | Symbol Theory
kuczynski | Given any language, the morphologies of inscriptions leave it entirely open what expressions have been tokened | Symbol Theory
kuczynski | We cannot even coherently conceive of a language where morphology alone determines what expression has been tokened | Symbol Theory
kuczynski | Even if there is only one way to token a language's symbols in practice, this cannot be an inherent fact about that language | Symbol Theory
kuczynski | Because symbol-tokens are relational, mere morphology-manipulation cannot constitute symbol-manipulation | CTM Critique
kuczynski | The information that is useful to an organism's survival is necessarily expressed by sentences with indexical components | Indexicals and Thought
kuczynski | Only thoughts of a strictly mathematical or philosophical nature can be expressed by indexical-free sentences | Indexicals and Thought
kuczynski | A token of if it is warm here, then it is warm here may encode a valid, invalid, or merely inductive argument depending on whether the indexicals co-refer | Indexicals and Logic
kuczynski | Even granting isomorphism between morphology and syntax, form-driven manipulation of symbols is more likely than not to fail to constitute valid reasoning | CTM Critique
kuczynski | Quine's analysis of logical truth fails because sentence-tokens like I am here now are naturally described as logically true | Logical Truth
kuczynski | A sentence is logically true not because of reinterpretations of non-logical constants but because its truth follows from semantic rules | Logical Truth
kuczynski | The operational definition of a term and the semantic meaning of that term are different things | Operational Definition
kuczynski | Hempel's arguments against operationalism are cogent when define is taken in the meaning-giving sense | Operationalism
kuczynski | The hypothesis that Smith is following rule R has predictive implications not had by the hypothesis that Smith merely accords with R | Rule-Following
kuczynski | After a certain point, it becomes only a skeptical possibility that Smith wasn't actually following the relevant rules | Rule-Following
kuczynski | Searle is right that calculators don't calculate, but wrong that acting like something that follows rules is little evidence of rule-following | Rule-Following
kuczynski | Timmy who can manipulate arithmetic symbols but cannot answer questions about shoes and houses does not really grasp arithmetic | Rule-Following
kuczynski | Calculators' behavior is more like that of the symbol-manipulating Timmy than like genuine arithmeticians | Calculators and Computation
kuczynski | The rule-following to which the calculator's behavior corresponds can be off-loaded onto the person behind the calculator | Calculators and Computation
kuczynski | If our behavior suggests rule-following involving concepts like NP-postposing, that rule-following must be attributed to us | Rule-Following
kuczynski | A set of semantic rules is constituted by psychological facts and the social and environmental facts in which they are embedded | Nature of Language
kuczynski | The mental state that precipitated my utterance is not constitutive of English but is caused by the existence of English | Language and Psychology
kuczynski | Some psychological states are constitutive of language—but not the immediate antecedents of utterances | Language and Psychology
kuczynski | Parole is language-use, not language-change—they must not be conflated | Language Change
kuczynski | A set of semantic rules is a structure, and a usage of an expression is a structure-internal event | Language Change
kuczynski | Events that constitute language-change are not constitutive of any existing set of semantic rules | Language Change
kuczynski | Lewis is wrong to think that a language is a set of function-theoretic pairings of properties with physical tokens | Nature of Language
kuczynski | Linguistic meaning never refers to purely function-theoretic pairings | Nature of Language
kuczynski | A proposition's existence presupposes that of its constituents, and its truth depends on facts about them | Propositional Structure
kuczynski | Where propositions are concerned, the concept of constituency is to be understood in terms of dependence | Propositional Structure
kuczynski | By identifying propositions with sets of properties, we can give clear answers to questions about propositional structure | Propositional Structure
kuczynski | The unity of the proposition—how constituents are combined—can be understood through relations of dependence | Propositional Structure
kuczynski | There is some kind of pre-verbal communication—infants and animals make themselves understood within limits | Non-Linguistic Communication
kuczynski | Language extends the scope and precision of existing non-verbal ways of communicating | Language and Communication
kuczynski | For something to be a symbol, there must be success conditions—this presupposes thought | Symbol and Success
kuczynski | The symbolic conception of thought is vacuous because it strips symbols of their essentially intentional character | CTM Critique
kuczynski | If thought is prior to language, then the symbolic conception of thought is viciously regressive | CTM Critique
kuczynski | Gricean theories of meaning cannot explain how sentences that have never been uttered already have definite meanings | Grice Critique
kuczynski | The compositional nature of sentence-meaning is incompatible with purely use-theoretic accounts of meaning | Compositionality
kuczynski | The problem with identifying language with function-theoretic pairings is that it makes language a platonic entity when it is spatiotemporal | Nature of Language
kuczynski | Saussure's distinction between langue and parole is legitimate—both are spatiotemporal entities | Saussure's Distinction
kuczynski | Languages as sets of semantic rules are distinct from the historical sequences of such rule-sets | Nature of Language
kuczynski | The expressivity of natural language far exceeds what can be captured by any purely morphological characterization | Language and Form
kuczynski | Mental states have content that is independent of facts about the causal origins of those states | Content Internalism
kuczynski | The concept of mental content must be distinguished from that of meta-content—what a representation is about versus facts about the representation | Content vs Meta-content
kuczynski | Conception is essentially descriptive in character, even though referring expressions are directly referential | Conception and Reference
kuczynski | The ability to think is a prerequisite to learning a language, not a consequence of it | Thought and Language
kuczynski | A theory is a way of modeling data, and in philosophy these data usually consist of intuitions | Philosophical Method
kuczynski | The differences cited by the content-externalist in defense of his position presuppose the truth of that position and thus don't provide independent support for it | Content Externalism Critique
kuczynski | There is a kind of representational content that Max and Twin-Max have in common that is not affected by the differences between their two worlds | Narrow Content
kuczynski | Narrow content is content that cannot differ between qualitatively identical individuals, leaving aside facts about the origins of their conditions | Narrow Content
kuczynski | Hard-line content-externalists like Burge, Evans, and McDowell deny that there is such a thing as narrow content | Hard-line Externalism
kuczynski | Fodor's view is that for x to have a concept of y is for some of x's states to have been caused, in a certain way, by states of affairs involving y | Fodor on Concepts
kuczynski | Fodor's analysis of conception involves my having a concept of Socrates being identical with my being on the receiving end of a causal chain beginning with Socrates | Causal Conception
kuczynski | CTM, SCT, and hard-line content-externalism all implicitly presuppose the truth of Fodor's causal analysis of conception | Fodor's Analysis
kuczynski | If one has a concept of y, it would seem one must already have various other concepts—conceptual atomism seems absurd | Conceptual Holism
kuczynski | Given a strictly causal analysis of conception, an otherwise conceptless being like a photographic plate could have a concept of Socrates | Conceptual Atomism Critique
kuczynski | The information encoded in a perception isn't neatly separable from background information, but there is still a clear line | Perception and Background
kuczynski | Perceptual content is existential: there is an object x of such and such a shape sitting next to an object y of thus and such a shape | Perceptual Content
kuczynski | To say that perceptual content is existential is not to say it consists of propositions—intuition resists exhausting perception with propositions | Perceptual Content
kuczynski | Content-externalism involves a failure to distinguish between content and truth-maker | Content vs Truth-maker
kuczynski | For a visual experience to be a perception of x, x must be part of the state of affairs that causes that experience, but x need not be a constituent of the content | Perception and Causation
kuczynski | By itself, no visual experience can tell you that it is x specifically, as opposed to some x-look-alike, that caused it | Perceptual Limits
kuczynski | Ostensive definitions work by way of knowledge of uniquely individuating descriptions | Ostensive Definition
kuczynski | The causal connection between you and Fred corresponds to context-sensitive terms in the description through which you grasp him | Causal Connection
kuczynski | In any case where a causal connection is constitutive of a concept, that connection is embedded in knowledge of some description the object uniquely satisfies | Causal-Descriptive Integration
kuczynski | You can acquire the ability to use a name meaningfully without ever having been given an ostensive or descriptive definition of it | Picking Up Names
kuczynski | Even when picking up a name from context, you know of some existence claim that is uniquely satisfied | Context and Reference
kuczynski | Socrates' existence must supervene on states of affairs that are not object-involving—ultimately on instances of properties | Metaphysics of Individuals
kuczynski | Roughly speaking, Socrates is a series of instances of properties | Property-Instance Theory
kuczynski | In any world where Socrates exists, his existence supervenes either on S or on some series only slightly different from S | Essential Origins
kuczynski | Whether one grasps a purely descriptive proposition supervenes on one's non-relational properties | Supervenience of Grasp
kuczynski | We can grasp a proposition whose truth presupposes Socrates' existence, contrary to Russell's claim about acquaintance | Against Russell
kuczynski | Socrates' existence in world w is a condition, but not a pre-condition, for the proposition's being true in w | Conditions vs Preconditions
kuczynski | Where sentences containing indexicals are concerned, it is de rigueur to distinguish between type-meaning and token-meaning | Types and Tokens
kuczynski | Given any sentence-type containing a tensed verb, the semantic content is a function that assigns propositions to tokens | Tense and Semantics
kuczynski | The distinction between sentence-types and sentence-tokens must be made universally | Universal Type-Token Distinction
kuczynski | A language is a means of communication, and the things that are heard, spoken, read, and written are tokens | Language as Communication
kuczynski | What is literally meant by an utterance must be distinguished from the information uploaded in computing its literal meaning | Pre-semantics
kuczynski | When we want to know what is communicated by statements, we must look at the epistemology of their semantics, not just the propositions | Communication and Epistemology
kuczynski | The concept of necessary a posteriori truth is a conflation of literally meant analytic truth and pre-semantically communicated contingent truth | A Posteriori Necessity Critique
kuczynski | What is literally meant by Hesperus is Phosphorus is analytic, but what is communicated is a posteriori—these must not be conflated | Hesperus-Phosphorus
kuczynski | For a proposition to be analytic is not for no empirical work to be needed to grasp its constituents, but for no empirical work to be needed to determine its truth-value once grasped | Analyticity
kuczynski | The idea of necessary a posteriori truth embodies a failure to distinguish semantics from pre-semantics | Necessary A Posteriori Critique
kuczynski | Even in paradigm cases of concepts having causal components, the content does not have the object as a constituent | Causal Concepts
kuczynski | A concept of Fred consists in knowledge of a description that Fred uniquely satisfies and that is not object-involving with respect to Fred | Concept Structure
kuczynski | Having a concept of x at time t involves knowing the truth of some existence claim in an interlocking series | Concepts as Knowledge-Series
kuczynski | A concept of x is identical with or supervenient on a knowledge-stream of interlocking existence claims | Knowledge-Stream Theory
kuczynski | One's concept of Fred is numerically identical with the concept one had of him days ago, despite changes in the sustaining descriptions | Concept Identity
kuczynski | To have a concept of x is to have discriminating knowledge of x, as Evans puts it | Discriminating Knowledge
kuczynski | A concept evolves continuously, just as a person or a plant does | Concept Evolution
kuczynski | Two different knowledge-streams can enable one to think about the same object, explaining how one can have two concepts of the same thing | Multiple Concepts
kuczynski | Recognition of identity like Fred equals Barney involves the convergence of two knowledge-streams | Identity Recognition
kuczynski | Understanding a sentence-token always involves having some kind of knowledge of the proposition it encodes, but often by description, not acquaintance | Understanding and Knowledge
kuczynski | One can believe a proposition to be true without grasping exactly that proposition—grasping involves singling out | Belief vs Grasp
kuczynski | Evans is wrong to think understanding demonstrative utterances consists in being acquainted with singular propositions | Evans Critique
kuczynski | Any proposition object-involving with respect to O can only be known by description, not by acquaintance | Knowledge by Description
kuczynski | Because linguistic communication involves identity of truth-maker, not proposition, people can communicate despite vast biographical differences | Communication and Truth-makers
kuczynski | Language cuts through biographical differences because linguistic communication is about what is external, not internal processes | External Communication
kuczynski | Given any two people who know what sad means, they will differ in the specifics of sensory information and internal states correlated | Semantic Knowledge Variation
kuczynski | Our model accommodates that sentences can unambiguously transmit information even though speakers access meaning through different bodies of information | Semantic Transmission
kuczynski | Nothing that Freud or Chomsky says is inconsistent with the truth that you know with Cartesian certainty what you are now consciously thinking | Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | The essence of content-externalism is that Descartes himself, not some description, is a constituent of certain thoughts of yours | Content Externalism Essence
kuczynski | If content-externalism is right, your knowledge of your own consciousness becomes as uncertain as your knowledge of early modern French history | Self-Knowledge Critique
kuczynski | Your thoughts about your thoughts inherit the same constitutive dependencies on the environment as your first-order thoughts | Thought Inheritance
kuczynski | The externalist's stratagem involves a failure to give due attention to distinctions of scope | Scope Distinctions
kuczynski | Given any guarantee provided by content-externalism, it is logical rather than causal in nature | Logical vs Causal Guarantee
kuczynski | The guarantee provided by content-externalism is of a logical, indeed tautologous, nature—not a causal guarantee | Tautological Guarantee
kuczynski | Causal relations are not expressed by tautologies | Causation and Tautology
kuczynski | Jackson and Pettit conflate the logical and causal dimensions of explanation | Jackson-Pettit Critique
kuczynski | Somebody's coughing is not a state of affairs and thus cannot be related to anything the way the flame is related to the heating of the pan | States of Affairs
kuczynski | The relationship between general existential statements and specific outcomes combines logical, effective-causal, and program-causal components | Explanation Types
kuczynski | The fact that A and A* are struck with the same force isn't a state of affairs—it has no spatio-temporal location | Abstract Facts
kuczynski | B's having functional role R provides no causal explanation since the latter is an analytic consequence of the former | Functionalism Critique
kuczynski | To know that an argument is formally correct, it is necessary to know only its syntactic structure, not its semantics | Formal Correctness
kuczynski | Syntactic form is completely different from geometrical form—morphology is a property of tokens, not types | Syntax vs Morphology
kuczynski | Two morphologically identical expression-tokens can have completely different syntactic forms | Morphology-Syntax Gap
kuczynski | What syntactic structure an expression has is a function of what it means—of its semantics | Syntax and Semantics
kuczynski | Given any sentence-type, there is no limit to how different in respect of morphology two tokens of it can be | Morphological Variation
kuczynski | The isomorphism between different tokens of the same type cannot be understood in strictly acoustical terms | Beyond Acoustics
kuczynski | Syntactic form has little or nothing to do with morphological form | Form Distinction
kuczynski | A being responding to form in the morphological sense is not thereby responding to form in the syntactic sense | Morphological vs Syntactic Response
kuczynski | The syntax of an expression lies in its semantics | Syntax in Semantics
kuczynski | A syntactic description of a sentence is a low-resolution description of its semantics | Syntax as Low-Resolution Semantics
kuczynski | A manipulation of symbols is syntax-driven only if it is semantics-driven | Syntax Requires Semantics
kuczynski | No disambiguation of the word form validates the idea that thinking consists in form-driven operations on symbols | Form Disambiguation
kuczynski | The equivocation between logical and morphological form creates the illusion that morphology-driven operations can realize logic-driven operations | Form Equivocation
kuczynski | Given any language rich enough to mediate human thoughts, syntactic structures will fail to track logical forms | Syntax-Logic Gap
kuczynski | The hypothesis that Smith is following rule R is confirmationally different from the hypothesis that he merely accords with R | Rule-Following Confirmation
kuczynski | If somebody grasps arithmetic, that knowledge will be expressed in ways other than symbolic manipulation | Arithmetic Knowledge
kuczynski | Unless calculators grasp the relevant symbolic conventions, it would be absurd to suppose their arithmetical knowledge would be expressed in symbolic tokenings | Calculator Knowledge
kuczynski | Knowledge of symbolic conventions presupposes the concept of denotation, which presupposes the concept of representation | Conceptual Prerequisites
kuczynski | If calculators have semantic knowledge, it is completely ex nihilo with none of the moorings we would expect | Calculator Semantic Knowledge
kuczynski | Even though calculators don't themselves compute, their behavior is appropriately understood in terms of actual computation | Calculator Behavior
kuczynski | A person can use a calculator to add—calculator activities are constitutive of actual computation though calculators don't compute | Calculators and Computation
kuczynski | The rule-following to which calculator behavior corresponds can be off-loaded onto the person behind the calculator | Off-Loading Rule-Following
kuczynski | To the extent our behavior suggests rule-following involving linguistic concepts, that rule-following must be attributed to us | Rule-Following Attribution
kuczynski | Wittgenstein's point that any course of action can be made to accord with a rule does not have the ramifications often thought | Wittgenstein on Rules
kuczynski | The hypothesis that I follow add one is confirmationally different from the hypothesis that I follow add a million then subtract 999,999 | Rule Confirmation
kuczynski | Unless radically counter-inductive assumptions are granted, the possibility of following bent rules isn't significant | Counter-Inductive Possibilities
kuczynski | Wittgenstein makes only the innocuous point that nothing about psychology is logically entailed by truths about overt behavior | Wittgenstein's Point
kuczynski | Given only one act, any hypothesis about rule-following is equiprobable with many others, but actual data-samples make bent hypotheses unlikely | Data Samples
kuczynski | Wittgenstein's position goes through only if there is an extremely strict connection between grasping a concept and acting in a certain way | Wittgenstein Critique
kuczynski | If I really am following a bent rule, there will be independent evidence—bent rule-following will be part of a history | Evidence of Bent Rules
kuczynski | Considered in isolation, a given act can have any number of psychological antecedents, but other evidence constrains interpretation | Act Interpretation
kuczynski | The concept of sub-personal mentation is not incoherent, contrary to what Wittgensteinians claim | Sub-Personal Mentation
kuczynski | Wittgenstein denies there can be private languages not parasitic on public language | Private Language
kuczynski | Given only that there is a syntactic characterization of inductive reasonableness, it doesn't follow our competence consists in sentence-sensitivity | Syntactic Characterization
kuczynski | Sensitization to syntax is sensitization to facts about how sentences are assigned meaning | Syntax and Assignment
kuczynski | So far as thinking is driven by facts about how expressions are assigned meaning, thinking is about that language, not in it | About vs In Language
kuczynski | If thinking were syntax-driven in an internal language, it would be viciously regressive since syntax concerns meaning-assignment | Syntax and Regress
kuczynski | The standard argument against SCT is that word-meaning is derivative of human thought, making linguistic thought viciously regressive | SCT Critique
kuczynski | What people think is part of what fixes what expressions mean | Thought Fixes Meaning
kuczynski | There is obviously non-linguistic communication—infants and animals can make themselves understood | Non-Linguistic Communication
kuczynski | Linguistic competence embodies bona fide knowledge of propositions about meanings and cannot be dispositionalized away | Linguistic Competence
kuczynski | Sub-sentential utterances don't have success-conditions, but the concept of success still explains their meaning contextually | Contextual Definition
kuczynski | For Fred to refer to Fred is for expressions of the form Fred has phi to have certain truth-conditions | Contextual Reference
kuczynski | It would be absurd to say Fred referred to Fred but deny that sentences of the form Fred has phi are true iff Fred has phi | Reference and Truth-Conditions
kuczynski | Grice's theory identifies expression-meaning with speaker's meaning, making it incapable of explaining sub-sentential expressions | Grice Critique
kuczynski | Even if the Gricean hypothesis about word-meaning origins is correct, it gives causal not conceptual analysis | Grice on Origins
kuczynski | We want to know what the semantic fact is, not how it came about—we want its structure | Semantic Structure
kuczynski | Agreement and understanding among people that noises of certain forms are successes under certain conditions endows those noises with meaning | Meaning and Agreement
kuczynski | The relevant kind of success does not have to be understood in linguistic terms | Non-Linguistic Success
kuczynski | What all sentences of the form Socrates has phi have in common is that they encode propositions of that form | Sentence Forms
kuczynski | Socrates' existence in world w is a condition for the proposition's truth but not a precondition for grasping it | Existence Conditions
kuczynski | One doesn't have to be near somebody by a fireplace to think about Fred—the initial existence claim must be replaced | Updating Existence Claims
kuczynski | Changes in the existence claim through which I access Fred register my changed chronological perspective, like changes in spatial perspective | Chronological Perspective
kuczynski | One typically forgets the existence claim through which one initially accessed an object | Forgetting Initial Access
kuczynski | Knowledge of a given existence claim can be dropped without destroying the concept if replaced by an interlocking one | Existence Claim Replacement
kuczynski | Understanding consists in associating an utterance with its meaning, but one effects this association through existence claims | Understanding Through Existence Claims
kuczynski | Demonstrative thoughts are not Russellian with respect to their demonstrata even though demonstrative utterances are | Demonstratives and Thought
kuczynski | You know what you are thinking with unimpeachable Cartesian certainty | Cartesian Self-Knowledge
kuczynski | Freud and Chomsky show we're unaware of much mental activity, but this doesn't show we lack all Cartesian certainties | Freud and Chomsky
kuczynski | Your knowledge that you're now thinking a proposition has a special certainty that cannot attach even to best substantiated beliefs about the external world | Special Certainty
kuczynski | The worlds where Burge's assumptions are granted are not the worlds where one has the Cartesian certainties he's tethering to those assumptions | Burge Critique
kuczynski | For all you know, you could be mistaking some non-thought for an actual thought, if content-externalism is right | Non-Thought Possibility
kuczynski | If you don't know with Cartesian certainty that you're having a thought, you don't know with Cartesian certainty which thought you're having | Thought Identity Certainty
kuczynski | Burge's argument begs the question by restricting attention to worlds where the relevant object has already been loaded into your thoughts | Begging the Question
kuczynski | Content-externalism entails you don't know with Cartesian certainty whether you're thinking I enjoy reading Descartes vs I enjoy reading Smith | Thought Discrimination
kuczynski | X's being a constituent of mental content is not a state of affairs in any causally significant sense when X and the thinker are separated by millions of years | Temporal Separation
kuczynski | Given that X is a constituent of Smith's mental content, some state of affairs involving X is causally responsible, but not X's being such a constituent | Constituent vs Cause
kuczynski | Not every non-empty noun-phrase denotes a state of affairs if by that we mean something of causal significance | Empty Causation
kuczynski | Flames, pegs, temperatures are operational—X's being a constituent of mental content is not operational when separated by millions of years | Operational Causation
kuczynski | Jackson and Pettit were misled by their own examples, which don't parallel the externalist case | Misleading Examples
kuczynski | A pre-condition for my knowing that Mary went to the airport is that linguistic communication not require strict cognitive convergence | Communication Without Convergence
kuczynski | For any true existence claim, its truth supervenes on the truth of some singular proposition—the truth-maker | Existence and Singularity
kuczynski | Somebody who recognizes an existence claim is thereby grasping the truth-maker proposition, but by description | Grasping Truth-Makers
kuczynski | One needn't be acquainted with a proposition to single it out | Singling Out
kuczynski | The naive view demands strict cognitive convergence between speaker and auditor—but that's impossible given our different biographies | Naive View Critique
kuczynski | Given our model of semantic competence, you and I are in complete lock-step regarding evidential and inferential significance of English sentences | Inferential Lock-Step
kuczynski | The validity of arguments literally meant perfectly mirrors the validity of arguments grasped by thoughts behind those words | Validity Mirroring
kuczynski | What we said about validity is true of truth, cogency, and every other logically significant property | Logical Properties
kuczynski | Even in a world where Smith doesn't exist, Jones could have a mental state identical in content and causal properties with his actual concept of Smith | Possible Worlds and Content
kuczynski | The content of a demonstrative concept is given by an existence claim which the demonstratum uniquely satisfies | Demonstrative Content
kuczynski | Even paradigm cases for content-externalism show the falsity of that doctrine when properly analyzed | Paradigm Case Failure
kuczynski | Premise 4 of Evans' argument is false—the proposition behind demonstrative utterances is existential, not singular | Evans Argument Critique
kuczynski | Premise 3 of Evans' argument is ambiguous—understanding can involve knowledge by description, not acquaintance | Ambiguity in Evans
kuczynski | Understanding a sentence does not require acquaintance with the proposition encoded—description suffices | Understanding by Description
kuczynski | Evans' argument is fallacious because it requires acquaintance when description is all that's possible | Evans Fallacy
kuczynski | In the hallucinatory scenario, there is no thought where Evans says there should be one—but the same is true in the veridical scenario | Hallucination Parity
kuczynski | Evans wrongly thinks understanding demonstratives requires acquaintance with singular propositions | Evans on Demonstratives
kuczynski | Objects we ordinarily think about—rocks, trees, vases—are far from fundamental constituents of space-time | Non-Fundamental Objects
kuczynski | Socrates' existence must supervene on facts about organs, organelles, molecules, and ultimately on non-object-involving states of affairs | Supervenience Chain
kuczynski | Given Kripke's points about essentiality of origins, Socrates could not have had dramatically different earlier life stages | Essential Origins Constraint
kuczynski | From a strictly biological standpoint, Socrates could not have been more than infinitesimally different from how he was | Biological Constraints
kuczynski | What fundamental means is context-dependent, but biological entities are nowhere near fundamental | Context of Fundamentality
kuczynski | People are sad in different ways, just as objects can be blue in different ways—turquoise, azure, and so on | Phenomenological Variation
kuczynski | Where expressions report inner states, it is especially important that communication involve identity of truth-maker, not proposition | Inner State Reports
kuczynski | Two barriers exist for inner-state expressions: perceptual differences in learning the word, and phenomenological differences in the states | Double Barrier
kuczynski | I have learned much from Aristotle's words—impossible if communication required exact thought-matching across our different life-histories | Learning from Ancients
kuczynski | Language makes communication possible by focusing on truth-makers rather than the internal processes through which we learn about what is external | Language's Role
kuczynski | One can tell people what one is thinking and feeling because linguistic communication doesn't require strict cognitive convergence | Expressing Inner States
kuczynski | Perceptions of numerically different but qualitatively identical objects have a great deal of existential information in common | Shared Existential Content
kuczynski | Content-externalists cannot accommodate the obvious fact that qualitatively identical perceptions share representational content | Shared Content Problem
kuczynski | McDowell's disjunctivism holds that perceptions of different objects have no content in common—but this is demonstrably false | Disjunctivism Critique
kuczynski | Soft content-externalism advocates a two-tiered conception of mental content | Two-Tiered Content
kuczynski | The statement that Max is in W as opposed to W* is without experimental significance when the worlds are Poincare-identical | Poincare Analogy
kuczynski | Just as absolute size and position are empty notions, so are the alleged differences between Max and Twin-Max | Empty Notions
kuczynski | It is suspicious on methodological grounds when alleged differences don't disrupt any relational facts | Methodological Suspicion
kuczynski | All of ostensive, descriptive, and picking-up modes of learning reference collapse into the descriptive | Collapse to Description
kuczynski | One's learning what an expression refers to always involves learning some description that singles out its referent | Learning Reference
kuczynski | To each kind of endeavor there corresponds a unique kind of success, as Aristotle noted | Success and Endeavor
kuczynski | The activity of exchanging information defines a unique sphere of conduct to which a special variety of success attaches | Communication Sphere
kuczynski | Pre-linguistic ancestors were intelligent enough to know they had methods of communication | Pre-Linguistic Awareness
kuczynski | Instituting agreements doesn't presuppose language since non-linguistic understandings are clearly possible | Non-Linguistic Agreements
kuczynski | If all communication were linguistic by definition, linguistic communication would be a pleonasm like unmarried bachelor | Terminological Point
kuczynski | The ability to grasp propositions is a prerequisite to the ability to use a language, not constituted by it | Grasp Precedes Language
kuczynski | Linguistic competence embodies bona fide knowledge of semantic rules, not mere dispositions | Knowledge vs Dispositions
kuczynski | Dispositions to use expressions in certain ways are effects of linguistic competence, not constitutive of it | Dispositions as Effects
kuczynski | Sub-sentential expressions are to be defined contextually—this was Frege and Russell's insight | Contextual Definition
kuczynski | While utterances of Fred have no success-conditions, whole sentences of the form Fred has phi do | Success and Sentence-Forms
kuczynski | The semantics of Fred is given by the success-conditions of sentences containing that name | Contextual Semantics
kuczynski | In putting forth our analysis of meaning, we are guilty of no vicious circularity | Non-Circular Analysis
kuczynski | Grice's theory cannot explain sub-sentential meaning since speaker's meaning necessarily diverges from word meaning for sub-sentential expressions | Grice on Sub-Sentential
kuczynski | Any two English speakers will access the meaning of practically any given sentence through different bodies of information | Variable Access
kuczynski | The truth-maker of my thought about Socrates will be identical with the truth-maker of yours, despite our different descriptive routes | Shared Truth-Makers
kuczynski | Mental entities have their representational contents essentially—it is absurd to suppose a perception could have had different content | Essential Content
kuczynski | V and V* satisfy the condition for identity of information: nothing can rationally be inferred from one that cannot be inferred from the other | Inferential Identity
kuczynski | To say that our perceptions make us aware of objects through existence-claims is not to say perceptual content is propositional | Non-Propositional Content
kuczynski | The causal connection between perceiver and perceived is a component of knowledge of a uniquely individuating description | Causal Component
kuczynski | A symbol-token's morphology imposes no constraints on its syntax | Morphology and Syntax
kuczynski | Two syntactically identical expression-tokens can have two completely different morphologies | Syntactic vs Morphological Identity
kuczynski | Given content-externalism, your counterpart in an epistemically identical world could fail to have thoughts you actually have | Counterpart Thought-Failure
kuczynski | The guarantee content-externalism provides that mental content has effects is tautologous, not causal | Tautologous Guarantee
kuczynski | When we assess causal potency, we study synthetic connections, not logical consequences of definitions | Causal Potency
kuczynski | The expression X's being a constituent of Smith's mental content does not denote a state of affairs in the causal sense | Non-State Expression
kuczynski | The fact that infinitely many primes exist is not an empty noun-phrase, but it doesn't denote a relatum of any true causal statement | Mathematical Facts and Causation
kuczynski | If all concepts were constitutively linked with other concepts, then it wouldn't be possible for two people to differ with respect to just one concept | Conceptual Holism Argument
kuczynski | To the extent that content-externalism is correct, concepts come one at a time and not in clusters | Atomism from Externalism
kuczynski | Given content-externalism, Fodor's atomism follows, as does his strictly causal conception of conception | Externalism Entails Atomism
kuczynski | The conceptual differences between Max and Twin-Max supervene wholly on the differences in their causal liaisons | Causal Supervenience
kuczynski | Most content-externalists have not gone so far as to accept conceptual atomism, but their systems are therefore inconsistent | Inconsistent Externalism
kuczynski | A computation is a formal operation on symbols—an operation causally driven by forms, not meanings, of symbols involved | CTM Definition
kuczynski | An immediate consequence of CTM is that thinking is not content-driven | CTM Consequence
kuczynski | The purely formal properties of symbols can be coordinated with their representational properties to explain relevant phenomena | Form-Content Coordination
kuczynski | It is a datum that certain kinds of thoughts are likely to follow other kinds—not that semantics is causally responsible for these patterns | Patterns vs Causation
kuczynski | Mary herself is part of the content of your visual perception, says the content-externalist | Externalist Claim
kuczynski | Pieces of information are individuated by their truth-conditions | Information Individuation
kuczynski | Mary is not a constituent of V's content—Mary is described by that content but not a component of it | Content vs Description
kuczynski | The content of an experience cannot be distinguished from what it tells you | Content as Information
kuczynski | If your visual experience doesn't tell you that Mary has phi, then Mary is no part of the content of that experience | Content Criterion
kuczynski | Given only what your eyes are telling you, you have no way of knowing whether you are seeing Mary or Twin-Mary | Perceptual Indiscriminability
kuczynski | It is clearly more reasonable to say that differential information interacts with perceptual information than that it is part of it | Interaction vs Inclusion
kuczynski | When Smith says Argo is a cad, you learn there is exactly one person Smith is describing as a cad on that occasion | Definite Description from Context
kuczynski | The information you are given is not confined to what Smith himself says—you have information about his saying it | Meta-Information
kuczynski | What enables you to use Argo to refer to Argo is your knowledge of some existence-claim that Argo uniquely satisfies | Reference Through Description
kuczynski | The principles that govern picking up a name apply whether you are one remove or five hundred removes from the referent | Transmission of Reference
kuczynski | A thought that has Socrates himself as a constituent obviously couldn't exist in counterfactual worlds where Socrates doesn't exist | De Re Thought Constraint
kuczynski | Spatiotemporal states of affairs are individuated by a certain privileged subset of their causal properties | Individuation by Causation
kuczynski | There is a possible world where O doesn't exist but where an awareness A having O as its object does exist with the same content | Awareness Without Object
kuczynski | An awareness has a counterfactually resilient relationship to its object only when that object is a constituent of that awareness | Counterfactual Resilience
kuczynski | Russell is right that the data encoded in one's thoughts never has Socrates per se as a constituent | Russell Vindicated
kuczynski | Any thought about Socrates is not de re with respect to Socrates, except perhaps in cases where the thinker is Socrates himself | No De Re External Thought
kuczynski | Objects like rocks, trees, and people are not the ultimate constituents of reality | Non-Fundamental Objects
kuczynski | Complexity is ultimately a property of propositions or explanations, not of objects | Complexity as Propositional
kuczynski | In the sub-atomic realm, there are no objects in any ordinary sense, only displacements of minute quanta of mass-energy | Sub-Atomic Reality
kuczynski | Anything worthy of being classified as a fundamental constituent of space-time couldn't participate in biological processes | Fundamental vs Biological
kuczynski | The truth of any singular proposition supervenes on that of some purely general proposition | Singular Supervenes on General
kuczynski | One can be acquainted with a proposition whose truth depends on that of some singular proposition | Acquaintance with General
kuczynski | Expressions denoting objects are either semantically simple or their complexity has nothing to do with the object's structure | Semantic Simplicity
kuczynski | Our tendency to think in terms of objects is encouraged by the fact that expressions denoting them are semantically simple | Linguistic Influence on Thought
kuczynski | Evans wrongly holds that in worlds where Descartes doesn't exist, you simply fail to have thoughts where you would have Descartes-thoughts | Evans on Missing Thoughts
kuczynski | From a psychologist's standpoint there would be no difference between thoughts in worlds where Descartes exists or not | Psychological Sameness
kuczynski | Content-externalism makes facts about representational content causally, and therefore psychologically, irrelevant | Content Without Causation
kuczynski | One thinks about Descartes through the right kind of uniquely individuating description—consistent with direct reference theory | Description and Direct Reference
kuczynski | In virtue of being a belief that 13 is prime, a brain-state has certain causal powers it wouldn't otherwise have | Content and Causal Power
kuczynski | A brain in a vat that was just like mine would be capable of having arithmetical thoughts | Envatted Mathematical Thought
kuczynski | It seems deeply arbitrary to suppose that content sometimes has causal powers and sometimes doesn't | Content Causation Consistency
kuczynski | The property of being a thought is sometimes, and sometimes is not, a psychological property according to content-externalism | Inconsistent Thought-Property
kuczynski | If one grasps Alpha Centauri, one does so by grasping some existence-claim available in any world | Universal Access
kuczynski | When we look at purely qualitative existential propositions, the property of being a thought of a certain kind is a psychological property | Psychological Property of Thought
kuczynski | What Fred takes away from Smith's utterance may be very different from Smith's thought, but they have the same truth-maker | Different Thoughts, Same Truth-Maker
kuczynski | The singular proposition x was wise is the truth-maker of both the proposition I associate with Socrates was wise and the one you associate | Shared Truth-Maker
kuczynski | Communication is possible only because it does not presuppose complete cognitive convergence between speaker and auditor | Communication Without Convergence
kuczynski | Communicating involves speaker and auditor associating propositions with the same truth-makers, not identical propositions | Communication as Truth-Maker Identity
kuczynski | Linguistic communication involves a coordination, not an identity, of thought | Coordination of Thought
kuczynski | Speaker and auditor must have parallel, not necessarily coincident, thoughts | Parallel Thoughts
kuczynski | Even if our thoughts are mediated by language, expressions of that language are replete with indexicals | Indexicals in Mentalese
kuczynski | Where indexicals are concerned, syntax cannot possibly track logical form | Syntax-Logic Divergence
kuczynski | Even if we grant CTM all its assumptions, it fails to account for our cognitive sensitivity to logical form | CTM Failure
kuczynski | There is no morphological characterization of syntax, no syntactic characterization of logic, no morphological characterization of logic | Triple Failure
kuczynski | A morphology-driven manipulation of symbols is not necessarily one that tracks either syntactic or logical form | Morphology vs Logic
kuczynski | The only thoughts expressible by indexical-free sentences are those concerning immutable relations among concepts | Indexical-Free Thought
kuczynski | Strawson made clear that where there are indexicals, there is necessarily a divergence between logical and syntactical form | Strawson on Indexicals
kuczynski | A token of if it is warm here then it is warm here may encode a valid, invalid, or inductive argument depending on co-reference | Indexical Validity Variation
kuczynski | Brown's behavior is symbol-driven because it is caused by his recognition that the ink-mark was the effect of certain socio-psychological conditions | Symbol-Driven Behavior
kuczynski | An object's functioning as a symbol involves someone's recognizing that it has certain origins | Symbols and Origins
kuczynski | A genuinely symbolic response to an ink-mark involves knowledge that it has certain origins—coincidentally correct belief won't suffice | Knowledge vs Lucky Belief
kuczynski | To accommodate the causal powers of symbol-tokens qua symbol-tokens, we must insist that an ink-mark is but one aspect of instantiating a symbol-type | Symbol-Token Complexity
kuczynski | Given only that the presence of what is in fact a symbol caused you to act, it doesn't follow your activity has any symbolic dimension | Caused vs Driven
kuczynski | CTM doesn't register the distinction between a behavior's being symbol-caused and its being symbol-driven | CTM Conflation
kuczynski | For a symbolic operation to be form-driven is for it to be driven by knowledge of at least some semantic properties of the symbols | Form Requires Semantics
kuczynski | Semantics is fixed at least in part by psychology, so sensitivity to semantics is confluent with sensitivity to psychology | Semantics-Psychology Connection
kuczynski | Even the content-externalist accepts that facts about human psychology are partially constitutive of semantic meaning | Psychology and Meaning
kuczynski | An ink-mark is at most one component of a symbol-token | Ink-Mark as Component
kuczynski | Whenever an ink-mark is a component of a symbol-token, its function is in large part to indicate operativeness of socio-psychological conditions | Morphology as Indicator
kuczynski | Two tokens of a single symbol-type may be morphologically very different from each other—there is no limit to the divergence | Morphological Elasticity
kuczynski | CTM needs morphological and semantic aspects of language to be in lockstep, but circumstances permitting such alignments are singularities | Alignment as Singularity
kuczynski | In taking morphology as primary, CTM erroneously takes singularities as paradigms and regards non-singularities as deviations | CTM's Error
kuczynski | Even under complete petrifaction of symbol-morphology, automatization of thought would be no more possible than under our conditions | Petrifaction Thought Experiment
kuczynski | Two distinct expressions can be betokened by physically indistinguishable objects—context determines which is being tokened | Context-Dependent Tokening
kuczynski | Context selects the appropriate disambiguation on the basis of the meanings of the symbols in question | Context and Meaning
kuczynski | Given any physical object O and any meaning M, there is some possible language L such that O means M in L | Arbitrary Meaning Assignment
kuczynski | By itself, an object's morphology does little to determine whether it tokens some expression-type of a language | Morphology Underdetermines Type
kuczynski | If you fail to enunciate or your calligraphy is poor, I won't know what you are saying—morphology imposes constraints | Morphological Constraints
kuczynski | Morphology only has an extremely partial role in determining whether a physical object betokens this as opposed to that expression-type | Partial Role of Morphology
kuczynski | The information through which one computes meanings is replete with conceptual structure | Pre-Semantic Structure
kuczynski | Every cognitively normal person can make extraordinarily delicate judgments about emotions, art, and physical bodies without articulating grounds | Unarticulated Judgment
kuczynski | Such judgments are at least sometimes principled, but the principles often fall outside introspective awareness | Sub-Personal Principles
kuczynski | Given that piece X has such musical properties, it follows conceptually, not inductively, that it is rock 'n' roll | Conceptual Classification
kuczynski | Jones may never articulate the grounds for judgments as efficiently as he operates with the term, but the concept still has analytic structure | Implicit Analytic Structure
kuczynski | What is sub-personally known vastly exceeds what is personally known along certain dimensions | Sub-Personal Knowledge
kuczynski | Information in the sub-personal realm is transmitted and processed exponentially faster than at the personal level | Sub-Personal Processing
kuczynski | If we act like things that follow rules involving concepts like c-command, there is good evidence we really do follow those rules | Rule-Following Evidence
kuczynski | The hypothesis that I follow add one is confirmationally different from the hypothesis that I merely accord with it | Following vs According
kuczynski | To show calculators don't compute, Searle must show that after background facts are considered, calculators don't act like arithmeticians | Searle's Burden
kuczynski | Unless calculators grasp semantic knowledge with independent evidence, it's absurd to suppose their tokening expresses arithmetical knowledge | Independent Evidence Needed
kuczynski | If calculators have semantic knowledge, it is completely ex nihilo with none of the moorings we would expect | Ex Nihilo Knowledge
kuczynski | Even though calculators don't compute, their behavior is appropriately understood in terms of actual computation | Calculator Interpretation
kuczynski | A person can use a calculator to add—calculator activities are constitutive of actual computation though calculators don't themselves compute | Constitutive Computation
kuczynski | The rule-following to which calculator behavior corresponds can be off-loaded onto the person behind the calculator | Off-Loading to Users
kuczynski | Given only that word-meaning is parasitic on human thought, it doesn't follow that Grice's analysis of meaning is right | Against Grice
kuczynski | What people think is part of what fixes what expressions mean | Thought Fixes Meaning
kuczynski | It is viciously regressive to suppose that we think in a language if word-meaning is parasitic on thought | SCT Regress
kuczynski | The SCT counter-response is to say that meanings of Mentalese symbols are not fixed by thought | Mentalese Reply
kuczynski | If Mentalese symbols' meanings aren't fixed by thought, it becomes questionable whether they deserve to be called symbols | Questionable Symbols
kuczynski | Scientific progress consists in making principled extensions of concepts, but SCT may have over-extended the concept of a symbol | Over-Extension
kuczynski | The word language is ambiguous, but not in the way Lewis thinks | Language Ambiguity
kuczynski | Linguistic meaning never refers to function-theoretic pairings, and language never refers to a set of such pairings | Against Function-Theoretic Meaning
kuczynski | Lewis is right that language is ambiguous but wrong about the nature of the ambiguity | Lewis Partly Right
